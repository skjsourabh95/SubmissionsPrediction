We should be able to replace the JSON files with actual API calls to integrate the app with the backend without much effort.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nYou must not hardcode any test data into the code.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>SCREEN REQUIREMENTS</strong><br />\nThe following screens from the design are in scope of this challenge. We&rsquo;ll provide design source file in the forum.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Login</strong><br />\nThis will be a simple login page without user sign up or forget password features. Assume users are pre-registered in the backend and they will use this page to login to the web portal.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nWe&rsquo;ll simply reuse the design from the mobile app login screen (Design Files / Patient / 01 New Patient / 03D Create Account) and make the following changes:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Make it larger to work with desktop.</li>\n\t<li>Remove the Back menu on top left corner</li>\n\t<li>Remove the texts &ldquo;We bring the doctor&rsquo;s office to you&rdquo; and &ldquo;Almost there&rdquo;</li>\n\t<li>Remove &ldquo;Forgot Password&rdquo; at the bottom</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>View scheduled appointments</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>After successful login, the user (physician) is redirected to this page: Design Files / Desktop Revised Flow / Physician Flow / 01 Physician - Home</li>\n\t<li>Ignore the Patients and Calendar icons on the left sidebar (i.e. these two are static icons for now and should be grayed out by default)</li>\n\t<li>The rightmost sidebar is also static for now (but do implement it as shown in design)</li>\n\t<li>Search and notifications on top right corner don&rsquo;t need to work for now</li>\n\t<li>The Upcoming Session section needs to work with dynamic data.</li>\n\t<li>The Recent Sessions section needs to work with dynamic data.

Do NOT use browser alerts, but use custom styles popups as shown in the design</li>\n\t<li>Show loading spinners when populating data from API / local JSON to UI</li>\n\t<li>Implement validation errors (for example: login error as shown in design)</li>\n\t<li>No linting errors</li>\n\t<li>No errors with prod builds</li>\n\t<li>You are expected to create a detailed README file including information on how to setup, run and verify your application.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>CODE REQUIREMENTS</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>ES6 syntax is preferred, as Babel has been setup to handle transpiling the syntax to the current JavaScript standard.</li>\n\t<li>Use .jsx extension for React components; using PascalCase for filenames. E.g., ComponentName/index.jsx.</li>\n\t<li>Do not create a single .css/.scss file for the whole app. Each component should have its own stylesheet file.</li>\n\t<li>Ensure that there are no lint errors.</li>\n\t<li>You&rsquo;re free to choose between CSS &amp; SCSS but you need to use flex instead of float.</li>\n\t<li>Follow a clean folder structure.</li>\n\t<li>Create reusable components.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>JAVASCRIPT REQUIREMENTS</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>All JavaScript must not have a copyright by a third party.

52k challenges over the past few years.</p>\n\n<p>In this challenge, Topcoder is reaching out to our creative Topcoder community to find ideas which will help with <strong>Topcoder challenge management</strong> and <strong>challenge success rates</strong>.</p>\n\n<h3>CHALLENGE BACKGROUND</h3>\n\n<p>Thanks to the amazing work from the community, Topcoder has been running over 52k challenges over the past few years.</p>\n\n<p>Topcoder is reaching out to our creative Topcoder community to</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Research on the historical challenge data</li>\n\t<li>Build ML workflow using AWS Sagemaker</li>\n\t<li>Use ML technology to help with\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Easy Topcoder challenge management</li>\n\t\t<li>Increase challenge success rates. Challenge success here means one challenge gets one successful submission (winner) in the end.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><strong>Task Detail</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Some data of past challenges is provided in the forum, which includes metadata for a challenge. We are open to any ideas which leverage machine learning, deep learning and the data shared. These ideas should help Topcoder team to have better challenge management or challenge success rates.</p>\n\n<p>Here are two examples:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Give advice to copilot about the prize of the new challenge by analyzing its specification.</li>\n\t<li>Before sending out to the community, if we are able to predict that one challenge would not get any submission, its copilot could do a lot, such as to modify challenge scope and to increase prize etc, to attract everyone to join the competition and make the challenge successful.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Please be creative, but also be realistic. If any data is needed but not included in current data, please ask in the forum and mention it in your report. In the first example idea, actually it requires challenge specification, which is not in current data.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Data Description</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Please find csv data attached in the forum. The csv headers should explain it very well.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>JUDGING CRITERIA and SCORECARD REVIEW</strong></h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>This submission will use the <a href=\"https://software.topcoder.com/review/actions/ViewScorecard?scid=30001620\">Idea Generation scorecard</a>.</li>\n\t<li>Your submission will be reviewed on these requirements:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Completeness of the idea</li>\n\t\t<li>Feasibility of the idea</li>\n\t\t<li>How much benefit it can provide to Topcoder platform</li>\n\t\t<li>Number of ideas given</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The winner will be chosen by the most logical and convincing reasoning as to how and why the idea presented will meet the objective. Note that, this contest will be judged subjectively by Topcoder. However, the judging criteria will largely be the basis for the judgement.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>SUBMISSION FORMAT GUIDE FOR THE WHITE PAPER:</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Your submission should include a text, .doc, PPT or PDF document that includes the following sections and descriptions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Overview</strong>: describe your approach in &ldquo;laymen&rsquo;s terms&rdquo;</li>\n\t<li><strong>Materials</strong>: did your approach use a specific technology? Any libraries? List all tools and libraries you considered part of your proposal</li>\n\t<li><strong>Discussion</strong>: Explain what you attempted, considered or reviewed that worked, and especially those that didn&rsquo;t work or that you rejected. For any that didn&rsquo;t work, or were rejected, briefly include your explanation for the reasons (e.g. such-and-such needs more data than we have). If you are pointing to somebody else&rsquo;s work (eg you&rsquo;re citing a well known implementation or literature), describe in detail how that work relates to this work, and what would have to be modified</li>\n\t<li><strong>Data</strong>: what about the data provided - is it enough to achieve your idea ? If not, what could be achieved and Why ?

The purpose of doing this is to avoid overfitting.</span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">We use the </span><strong>weight F1 score</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\"> metric to evaluate your submission. Since this is a multi-class classification problem, we will compute the F1 score for each class label following the </span><span style=\"color:rgb(29, 31, 34); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">one-vs-rest transformation.</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Focusing on the </span><strong>i</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">-th OIICS label, we will transform the groundtruth labels and predicted labels to binary labels: </span><strong>1</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\"> means it is the </span><strong>i</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">-th OIICS label, while </span><strong>0 </strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">means it is not.

color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">This sprint is part of the second phase of the Rodeo II Challenge, which follows after the previous marathon match</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">. Big part of the problem statement is the same, but there are also some major changes. It is not required that you took part in the previous marathon match to take part in this sprint.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Water managers need more skillful information on weather and climate conditions to help efficiently utilize water resources to reduce the impact of hydrologic variations.&nbsp; Examples of hydrologic variations include the onset of drought or a wet weather extreme. Lacking skillful sub-seasonal information limits water managers&rsquo; ability to prepare for shifts in hydrologic regimes and can pose major threats to their ability to manage the valuable resource.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The challenge of sub-seasonal forecasting encompasses the lead times of 15 to 45 days into the future, which lay between those of weather forecasting (i.e. up to 15 days, where initial ocean and atmospheric conditions matter most) and seasonal to longer-lead climate forecasting (i.e. beyond 45 days, where slowly varying earth system conditions matter most, such as sea surface temperatures, soil moisture, snow pack).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The Rodeo II Challenge series is a continuation of&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.drought.gov/drought/sub-seasonal-climate-forecast-rodeo\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Sub-Seasonal Climate Forecast Rodeo I</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">&nbsp;contest.

The primary component of Rodeo I was a year of submitting forecasts every 2 weeks in real-time. Teams were ranked on their performance over the year and needed to outperform two benchmark forecasts from&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">NOAA</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">. Additional prize eligibility requirements included a method documentation summary, 11-year hind-casts, and code testing.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The current challenge is the&nbsp;</span><strong>second</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">&nbsp;step in a series of contests that builds on the results of Rodeo I. This document is the problem specification of 4 &times; 26 (in total, 104) recurring data science challenges (sprints) that aim to create good quality predictive algorithms on weather data over the next full year.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">There will be 4 independent tracks (the same as in the marathon match) - in each you will be solving a specific task. Each track will be split into 26 sprints, with each sprint lasting 2 weeks. There will be separate prizes for each sprint. There will also be quarterly and overall (annual) bonus prizes. To be eligible for the quarterly and annual prizes, you must outperform both the winning solution for that category from Rodeo I and a sub-seasonal forecast from NOAA.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Prize Structure</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;

The minimum permitted size of a team is 1 member, with no upper limit. However, our teaming form only allows up to 10 members in a team. If you have more than 10 members in your team, please email us directly at support@topcoder.com and we will register your team. Only team Captains may submit a solution to the Competition. Notwithstanding Topcoder rules and conditions to the contrary, solutions submitted by any Topcoder member who is a member of a team on this challenge but is not the Captain of the team are not permitted, are ineligible for award, may be deleted, and may be grounds for dismissal of the entire team from the challenge. The deadline for forming teams is 11:59pm ET on the 14th day following the start date of each scoring period. Topcoder will prepare a Teaming Agreement for each team that has completed the Topcoder Teaming Form, and distribute it to each member of the team. Teaming Agreements must be electronically signed by each team member to be considered valid. All Teaming Agreements are void, unless electronically signed by all team members by 11:59pm ET of the 21st day following the start date of each scoring period.

color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">. Big part of the problem statement is the same, but there are also some major changes.

Lacking skillful sub-seasonal information limits water managers&rsquo; ability to prepare for shifts in hydrologic regimes and can pose major threats to their ability to manage the valuable resource.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The challenge of sub-seasonal forecasting encompasses the lead times of 15 to 45 days into the future, which lay between those of weather forecasting (i.e. up to 15 days, where initial ocean and atmospheric conditions matter most) and seasonal to longer-lead climate forecasting (i.e. beyond 45 days, where slowly varying earth system conditions matter most, such as sea surface temperatures, soil moisture, snow pack).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The Rodeo II Challenge series is a continuation of&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.drought.gov/drought/sub-seasonal-climate-forecast-rodeo\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Sub-Seasonal Climate Forecast Rodeo I</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">&nbsp;contest.

The primary component of Rodeo I was a year of submitting forecasts every 2 weeks in real-time. Teams were ranked on their performance over the year and needed to outperform two benchmark forecasts from&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">NOAA</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">.

To be eligible for the quarterly and annual prizes, you must outperform both the winning solution for that category from Rodeo I and a sub-seasonal forecast from NOAA.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Prize Structure</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;

The minimum permitted size of a team is 1 member, with no upper limit. However, our teaming form only allows up to 10 members in a team. If you have more than 10 members in your team, please email us directly at support@topcoder.com and we will register your team. Only team Captains may submit a solution to the Competition. Notwithstanding Topcoder rules and conditions to the contrary, solutions submitted by any Topcoder member who is a member of a team on this challenge but is not the Captain of the team are not permitted, are ineligible for award, may be deleted, and may be grounds for dismissal of the entire team from the challenge. The deadline for forming teams is 11:59pm ET on the 14th day following the start date of each scoring period. Topcoder will prepare a Teaming Agreement for each team that has completed the Topcoder Teaming Form, and distribute it to each member of the team. Teaming Agreements must be electronically signed by each team member to be considered valid. All Teaming Agreements are void, unless electronically signed by all team members by 11:59pm ET of the 21st day following the start date of each scoring period.

color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">. Big part of the problem statement is the same, but there are also some major changes.

Lacking skillful sub-seasonal information limits water managers&rsquo; ability to prepare for shifts in hydrologic regimes and can pose major threats to their ability to manage the valuable resource.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The challenge of sub-seasonal forecasting encompasses the lead times of 15 to 45 days into the future, which lay between those of weather forecasting (i.e. up to 15 days, where initial ocean and atmospheric conditions matter most) and seasonal to longer-lead climate forecasting (i.e. beyond 45 days, where slowly varying earth system conditions matter most, such as sea surface temperatures, soil moisture, snow pack).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The Rodeo II Challenge series is a continuation of&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.drought.gov/drought/sub-seasonal-climate-forecast-rodeo\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Sub-Seasonal Climate Forecast Rodeo I</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">&nbsp;contest.

The primary component of Rodeo I was a year of submitting forecasts every 2 weeks in real-time. Teams were ranked on their performance over the year and needed to outperform two benchmark forecasts from&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">NOAA</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">.

To be eligible for the quarterly and annual prizes, you must outperform both the winning solution for that category from Rodeo I and a sub-seasonal forecast from NOAA.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Prize Structure</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;

Each team must declare a Captain. All participants in a team must be registered Topcoder members in good standing. All participants in a team must individually register for this Competition and accept its Terms and Conditions prior to joining the team. Team Captains must apportion prize distribution percentages for each teammate on the Teaming Form. The sum of all prize portions must equal 100%. The minimum permitted size of a team is 1 member, with no upper limit. However, our teaming form only allows up to 10 members in a team. If you have more than 10 members in your team, please email us directly at support@topcoder.com and we will register your team. Only team Captains may submit a solution to the Competition. Notwithstanding Topcoder rules and conditions to the contrary, solutions submitted by any Topcoder member who is a member of a team on this challenge but is not the Captain of the team are not permitted, are ineligible for award, may be deleted, and may be grounds for dismissal of the entire team from the challenge. The deadline for forming teams is 11:59pm ET on the 14th day following the start date of each scoring period. Topcoder will prepare a Teaming Agreement for each team that has completed the Topcoder Teaming Form, and distribute it to each member of the team. Teaming Agreements must be electronically signed by each team member to be considered valid. All Teaming Agreements are void, unless electronically signed by all team members by 11:59pm ET of the 21st day following the start date of each scoring period. Any Teaming Agreement received after this period is void. Teaming Agreements may not be changed in any way after signature.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Relinquish - Topcoder is allowing registered competitors or teams to &quot;relinquish&quot;.

/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Remark</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">This sprint is part of the second phase of the Rodeo II Challenge, which follows after the previous marathon match</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">. Big part of the problem statement is the same, but there are also some major changes. It is not required that you took part in the previous marathon match to take part in this sprint.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Water managers need more skillful information on weather and climate conditions to help efficiently utilize water resources to reduce the impact of hydrologic variations.&nbsp; Examples of hydrologic variations include the onset of drought or a wet weather extreme. Lacking skillful sub-seasonal information limits water managers&rsquo; ability to prepare for shifts in hydrologic regimes and can pose major threats to their ability to manage the valuable resource.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The challenge of sub-seasonal forecasting encompasses the lead times of 15 to 45 days into the future, which lay between those of weather forecasting (i.e. up to 15 days, where initial ocean and atmospheric conditions matter most) and seasonal to longer-lead climate forecasting (i.e. beyond 45 days, where slowly varying earth system conditions matter most, such as sea surface temperatures, soil moisture, snow pack).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The Rodeo II Challenge series is a continuation of&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.drought.gov/drought/sub-seasonal-climate-forecast-rodeo\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Sub-Seasonal Climate Forecast Rodeo I</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">&nbsp;contest. In December 2016, the&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.usbr.gov/\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">US Bureau of Reclamation</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">&nbsp;launched Rodeo I. The primary component of Rodeo I was a year of submitting forecasts every 2 weeks in real-time. Teams were ranked on their performance over the year and needed to outperform two benchmark forecasts from&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">NOAA</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">. Additional prize eligibility requirements included a method documentation summary, 11-year hind-casts, and code testing.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The current challenge is the&nbsp;</span><strong>second</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">&nbsp;step in a series of contests that builds on the results of Rodeo I. This document is the problem specification of 4 &times; 26 (in total, 104) recurring data science challenges (sprints) that aim to create good quality predictive algorithms on weather data over the next full year.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">There will be 4 independent tracks (the same as in the marathon match) - in each you will be solving a specific task. Each track will be split into 26 sprints, with each sprint lasting 2 weeks. There will be separate prizes for each sprint. There will also be quarterly and overall (annual) bonus prizes. To be eligible for the quarterly and annual prizes, you must outperform both the winning solution for that category from Rodeo I and a sub-seasonal forecast from NOAA.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Prize Structure</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The total sum of all prizes is&nbsp;</span><strong>$720,000</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial;

If you have more than 10 members in your team, please email us directly at support@topcoder.com and we will register your team. Only team Captains may submit a solution to the Competition. Notwithstanding Topcoder rules and conditions to the contrary, solutions submitted by any Topcoder member who is a member of a team on this challenge but is not the Captain of the team are not permitted, are ineligible for award, may be deleted, and may be grounds for dismissal of the entire team from the challenge. The deadline for forming teams is 11:59pm ET on the 14th day following the start date of each scoring period. Topcoder will prepare a Teaming Agreement for each team that has completed the Topcoder Teaming Form, and distribute it to each member of the team. Teaming Agreements must be electronically signed by each team member to be considered valid. All Teaming Agreements are void, unless electronically signed by all team members by 11:59pm ET of the 21st day following the start date of each scoring period. Any Teaming Agreement received after this period is void. Teaming Agreements may not be changed in any way after signature.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Relinquish - Topcoder is allowing registered competitors or teams to &quot;relinquish&quot;.

As long as we follow README.md and we will able to validate result through Sagemaker HTTPS endpoint, it&#39;s acceptable.</p>\n\n<p>Please make sure all steps are well documented, and all code should be in separated files.</p>\n\n<p>You can create training job in AWS Sagemaker web console or API, either is acceptable.</p>\n\n<p>If you are not able to launch training instance because of AWS account

It will be tested on this page, so make sure your JSON file renders properly: <a href=\"https://lottiefiles.com/preview\">https://lottiefiles.com/preview</a></li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Screen Specifications</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Phone: 750px width, 1334px height.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Branding Guidelines</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>A logo is provided (see forums).&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Follow the branding document and Telehealth website for style reference. Not to be considered a limiting factor.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Target Audience</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Targeted to the US only.</li>\n\t<li>Focus on current Telehealth patients.</li>\n\t<li>Registered Patients: patients that have registered an online account.</li>\n\t<li>Non-Registered Patients: patients that have not yet registered an online account.</li>\n\t<li>Majority of the patients of ours are between 30 - 70 years old. 50 - 59, and 60 - 69 age brackets do skew higher for us. Slightly more female than male.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Judging Criteria</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>How well you execute the animation.</li>\n\t<li>Can your After Effects file successfully export the JSON file using Bodymovin?</li>\n\t<li>Cleanliness of your graphics and design.</li>\n\t<li>Creativity of the animation.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Final Deliverables</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>All original source files.</li>\n\t<li>Files should be created in Adobe After Effects.</li>\n\t<li>MPG or GIF video of the motion animation.</li>\n\t<li>Deliver the JSON file exported from

KPIs ideation challenge","description":"<h2>Challenge Overview</h2>\nThe client for this challenge is a large telecom / mobile network operator.<br />\nOn this challenge, We are reaching out to the Topcoder data science community to get ideas which will help to build /develop an algorithm that can analyze historical data and predict 5 separate key performance indicators (KPIs) on the radio access networks (RAN), up to 2 hours in advance with 85% accuracy.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nThe eventual solution will be built in later phases and not by this challenge.&nbsp; In this challenge we seek your analysis of the problem, advice on how to solve it, and a proof of concept demonstrating the potential of your idea.&nbsp; Some data cleansing and preparation is necessary and included within scope of this challenge.<br />\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Prediction target:</h3>\nThe target is for the 5 KPIs below, two hours into the future.&nbsp; So, if we want to predict the KPIs at 11AM for a specific lncel_name, we can train using the date from 9AM and before, make the prediction, and then compare to the actual values at 11AM.&nbsp; Client objective is&nbsp; 85% accuracy with the given data. &nbsp;\n\n<h3>Background</h3>\nBelow are the 5 RAN KPIs that we want to predict -\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Download (DL) physical resource block (PRB) Utilisation</strong> - This KPI shows the average value of the Physical Resource Block(PRB) utilization per TTI(Transmission Time Interval) in downlink direction. The utilization is defined by the ratio of used to available PRBs per TTI. &nbsp;\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>In the data, this is the e_utran_avg_prb_usage_per_tti_dl column</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>DL Traffic Volume</strong> - This KPI is the Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) and Service data Unit (SDU) volume on an eUu interface per cell in a downlink direction.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>In the data, this is the pdcp_sdu_volume__dl column</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>DL Average End User Throughput</strong> - This KPI indicates the IP scheduled end-user throughput in DL for QCIx Services. Unit of Kbps.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>In the data, this is the avg_pdcp_cell_thp_dl column</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Average number of users</strong> -This KPI shows the average number of User Equipment (UEs) having one PRB during the measurement period.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>In the data, this is the avg_act_ues_dl column</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Spectrum Efficiency</strong> - Spectral efficiency usually is expressed as &ldquo;bits per second per hertz,&rdquo; or bits/s/Hz. In other words, it can be defined as the net data rate in bits per second (bps) divided by the bandwidth in hertz. Net data rate and symbol rate are related to the raw data rate which includes the usable payload and all overhead.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>In the data, the columns are dl_spectral_efficiency and ul_spectral_efficiency</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<h3>General Terminology:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>DL PRB Utilisation</strong>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><a href=\"https://www.teoco.com/latest/news/blog/lte-capacity-planning-and-prb-dimensioning-ensuring-quality-of-service-in-an-increasingly-complex-network/\">https://www.teoco.com/latest/news/blog/lte-capacity-planning-and-prb-dimensioning-ensuring-quality-of-service-in-an-increasingly-complex-network/</a></li>\n\t\t<li><a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/KlajdiHusi/lte-capacity-monitoring\">https://www.slideshare.net/KlajdiHusi/lte-capacity-monitoring</a></li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>DL Traffic Volume</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313101068_Telecommunication_Traffic_Unit_and_Traffic_Mathematical_Model\">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313101068_Telecommunication_Traffic_Unit_and_Traffic_Mathematical_Model</a></li>\n\t\t<li><a href=\"https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/events/wtim2012/012-E_doc.pdf\">https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/events/wtim2012/012-E_doc.pdf</a></li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>DL Average End User Throughput</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><a href=\"http://www.techtrained.com/cell-throughput-vs-ue-throughput-or-socialism-vs-capitalism-in-cellular-networks/\">http://www.techtrained.com/cell-throughput-vs-ue-throughput-or-socialism-vs-capitalism-in-cellular-networks/</a></li>\n\t\t<li><a href=\"https://www.netmanias.com/en/post/blog/11339/lte/lte-and-beyond-dl-throughput-comprehensive-calculations\">https://www.netmanias.com/en/post/blog/11339/lte/lte-and-beyond-dl-throughput-comprehensive-calculations</a></li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Spectrum Efficiency</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_efficiency\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_efficiency</a></li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Data description and Key data challenge :</h3>\nHistory data is provided as a large CSV file with 256 columns and approximately 16,000,000 records.&nbsp; This data is sorted by date in the period_start_time_date column.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t have to use all the data in the CSV file, but there should be plenty there to test correlations and models.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>We have very limited documentation on what the columns represent.&nbsp; You can ask about certain ones, but the only ones we know for sure are the KPI columns</strong> (detailed above), the <span style=\"font-family:courier new,courier,monospace\">period_start_time, mrbts_sbts_name</span>, which is the tower ID, <span style=\"font-family:courier new,courier,monospace\">lnbts_name</span>, which is the site ID, and <span style=\"font-family:courier new,courier,monospace\">lncel_name</span>, which is the cell name.<br />\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Task Detail</h3>\n&nbsp;In this Ideation challenge, we are looking for ideas for the following problems:\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Understand current set of data gathered and your observations/Ideas of Data quality in order to build an algorithm which can compute the 5 KPI&rsquo;s</li>\n\t<li>Your&nbsp; findings re. Useful features and your recommendations to develop a better algorithm</li>\n\t<li>What approaches/ modelling techniques can be used to meet the KPIs.&nbsp; What are the risks or consequences of using your approach (for example, for some hypothetical problem, SARIMAX may not perform as well as LSTM, but is more explainable in terms of cause and effect of an input variable changing).</li>\n</ol>\n<br />\nThe final deliverables is a report explaining the algorithm and&nbsp; PoC ( Python 3) that will demonstrate your idea. More details are discussed in the Final Submission section.\n<h3>Submission Format Guide for the White Paper:</h3>\nYour submission should include a text, .doc, PPT or PDF document that includes the following sections and descriptions:\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Overview</strong>: describe your approach in &ldquo;laymen&rsquo;s terms&rdquo;</li>\n\t<li><strong>Methods</strong>: describe what you did to come up with this approach, eg literature search, experimental testing, etc</li>\n\t<li><strong>Materials</strong>: did your approach use a specific technology?&nbsp; Any libraries?&nbsp; List all tools and libraries you considered part of your proposal</li>\n\t<li><strong>Discussion</strong>: Explain what you attempted, considered or reviewed that worked, and especially those that didn&rsquo;t work or that you rejected.&nbsp; For any that didn&rsquo;t work, or were rejected, briefly include your explanation for the reasons (e.g. such-and-such needs more data than we have).&nbsp; If you are pointing to somebody else&rsquo;s work (eg you&rsquo;re citing a well known implementation or literature), describe in detail how that work relates to this work, and what would have to be modified</li>\n\t<li><strong>Data</strong>:&nbsp; what about the data described/provided - is it enough to achieve the 5 KPI&rsquo;s with 85% accuracy ? If not, what could be achieved and Why ? Any Correlations in the data that may not be immediately obvious</li>\n\t<li><strong>Feasibility</strong>: GIven the data and approach you implemented, How feasible and realistic it is and Why ? What level of prediction accuracy can be obtained using this approach and justification for the same ?</li>\n\t<li><strong>Assumptions and Risks</strong>: what are the main risks of this approach, and what are the assumptions you/the model is/are making?&nbsp; What are the pitfalls of the data set and approach?</li>\n\t<li><strong>Results</strong>: Did you implement your approach?&nbsp; How&rsquo;d it perform? &nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><strong>Other</strong>: Discuss any other issues or attributes that don&rsquo;t fit neatly above that you&rsquo;d also like to include</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Judging Criteria</h3>\nYou will be judged on the quality of your ideas, the quality of your description of the ideas, and how much benefit it can provide to the client. The winner will be chosen by the most logical and convincing reasoning as to how and why the idea presented will meet the objective. However, the judging criteria will largely be the basis for the judgement.\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Feasibility and Completeness</strong>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Did you complete the sections as required above</li>\n\t\t<li>What&#39;re the key insights we can get from your analysis to meet client objectives ?</li>\n\t\t<li>Data quality findings/ Can you model predict 2 hours in advance</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Feasibility</strong>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>PoC code is presented</li>\n\t\t<li>Does your submission include enough detail for us to understand if this approach is feasible?</li>\n\t\t<li>Is your solution more likely feasible than other submissions to the challenge?</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Final Submission Guidelines</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Documentation (in text, .doc, .pdf, or .md format)</li>\n\t<li>Code (in a Jupyter Notebook with readme)\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>&nbsp;Please provide a&nbsp; single configuration variable to allow us to change the location of the data for reviewer systems.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t hard-code the path to all the files.</li>\n\t\t<li>&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t require hardware,

In the Power World program, we are looking for data analysis to better evaluate the impact on various social systems and actors due to various events, like an election, and how wealth is distributed and changes in the data.&nbsp; This challenge will focus on questions from the client about how the world described in the data will change if we adjust certain parameters for agents and groups.</span></h2>\n<br />\n<br />\nPower World, broadly, is all about social dynamics, policy elections, and group competitions.&nbsp; There are more minor factors than these included, you should consider their effects as well.<br />\n<br />\nWe&rsquo;ve had two editions of the world, Explain (WE) and Predict (WP). These worlds have the same underlying causal model, but are different samples &ndash; e.g. agent101 in WE and WP won&rsquo;t have the same values across worlds, but within the world the agent is the same. We note this because incoming data (later) should be sampled from both WE and WP, so these might be thought of as means to test generalization or used to validate data analyses &ndash; as broader patterns from WP should exist in WE. For example, <strong>factor X drives factor Y</strong>, this may not be exactly the same values but that causal direction should exist in both and be approximately the same &ldquo;amount of driving.&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Task Detail</h2>\nWe have some initial datasets provided, with descriptions below as follows. The RunDataTable describes demographic information and policy-related vote information of each individual, and the RelationshipDataTable describes the social relations between these individuals.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>RunDataTable</strong><br />\nThis Initial Data Package contains data collected from five isolated societies, one main society and four neighboring societies. Each of these societies have essentially the same causal factors for individual, group, and societal behaviors despite some minor cultural differences.<br />\n<br />\nThe Prescribe Questions are asking about only this society. Data collected from this society is reported in data table files without any appended society number, e.g. RunDataTable-Census.tsv, RelationsipDataTable-GSS.tsv, etc. Entities such as agents and groups in this society have unique names that also do not have any appended numbers, e.g. agent0, agent1, agent2, etc. and group0, group1, etc.<br />\n<br />\nData collected from the neighbouring societies is reported in data tables with the society number attached, e.g. RunDataTable-Census-Society-2.tsv, RelationshipDataTable-GSS-Society-2.tsv, etc. Entities such as agents and groups in these societies also have their society number appended to their names to distinguish them from entities in other societies. For example, agents in Society 2 are named agent0-2, agent1-2, agent2-2, etc. and groups in Society 2 are named group0-2, group1-2, etc.<br />\n<br />\nThere are no interactions between entities that are in different societies. For example, agents in the main society do not know about or interact with agents in Society 2. Similarly, agents in Society 3 do not know about and cannot join or interact with groups in Society 4, etc.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nThe full dataset can be downloaded from the forum.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nIn addition, we have provided data from a number of research requests that the client has fulfilled.&nbsp; You will see those in the &ldquo;Research Requests&rdquo; folder of the data pack.&nbsp; A document describing the data collected in each research request will be provided in the forum as well.&nbsp; These Research Requests are strictly for Society 1 (the main society), no further data is provided for the satellite societies.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Final Prescribe Goals</strong>: Given all the data of a number of societies, we want to answer questions the client has provided about how the world will change based on adjustments made to the data. You may want to build separate models for different questions.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Question 1:</strong><br />\nWhich location should Agent 55 live in from Days 1001 to 1200 to maximize the average group identification among all the groups they are members of on Day 1200? (Assume that Agent 55 can move to any location at Day 1001, but then must stay at that location until Day 1200.)<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Question 2:</strong><br />\nIf Agent 112 quits all their current groups on Day 1001 and then joined one group, which group would result in the lowest happiness on Day 1200 assuming no other group joins/leaves occurred in any group during this time period? (Agent 112 can choose any group, including any that it has quit on Day 1001.)<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Question 3:</strong><br />\nSuppose Group 1 can recruit all of the members of another group to join Group 1. Which group should they recruit at Day 1001 to join them in order to maximize the average group identification of all members of Group 1 (including the original members and the recruited members) feel toward that group at Day 1100?<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Question 4:</strong><br />\nIf Group 8 recruited all individuals who were not in any other group to join Group 8 at Day 1001, which policy should Group 8 endorse (if they endorse only one policy) at the next election after Day 1001, to maximize the number of contests that Group 8 wins between Day 1001 and Day 1100?<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Question 5:</strong><br />\nConsider the transfer of wealth from the richest 10% of individuals to the poorest 10%. If this transfer takes place once on Day 1001, how much money should be transferred, per person, assuming the same amount is taken or given to each individual, to create the greatest average happiness on Day 1021 of all individuals involved in the wealth transfer? (Range of options for money amount is [$0, $2,000] in increments of $100)<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Question 6:</strong><br />\nIf the MaxHappiness Policy was activated globally and in every location on Day 1001 and stayed enacted until Day 1100, in which location should $100 be distributed to each agent on Day 1001, to increase wealth disparity in the world the most by Day 1100?<br />\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Goal of This Challenge:</h2>\n<br />\nYou are asked to build models and investigation code to fully document the answers to the questions above.&nbsp; Please do this in a Jupyter notebook.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Jupyter notebook</strong><br />\n<br />\nTo make the Jupyter notebook easy to review, please ensure that you meet the following requirements:\n<ul>\n\t<li>The data should be loaded from the exact file and folder structure provided in the data pack.</li>\n\t<li>Please provide a clear, single, configuration variable to allow us to change the location of the data for reviewer systems.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t hard-code the path to all the files.</li>\n\t<li>Please provide comments, in markdown format, in the Jupyter notebook explaining your thought process and what was being explored and why you went in certain directions.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Answer document</strong><br />\n<br />\nYou should also provide a <strong>separate</strong> answer document, in addition to the Jupyter notebook(s) <strong>Do not</strong> leave anything to be assumed here, no matter how trivial.&nbsp; This will be part of the review at the end of the challenge, so the more information you provide, and the better your documentation is, the better your chances of winning will be.<br />\n<br />\nThe answer document should clearly describe:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Any assumptions you made with regards to the data, and why you decided to make those assumptions</li>\n\t<li>How you decided what data to use to answer each of the questions</li>\n\t<li>The actual answer to each question, in as detailed a manner as possible.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be vague here - if the question is asking for a specific group or location, please clearly say the group or location that is your answer</li>\n\t<li>How you came up with the answer and the justification behind why you think it&rsquo;s the best answer to the question.&nbsp; Please back this up with data obtained via data analysis and through the Jupyter Notebook code.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;\n<h3>Submission</h3>\nThe final submission must include the following items.\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>A Jupyter notebook detailing:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>How the data is prepared and cleaned, from the tsv files</li>\n\t\t<li>How individual answers are analysed</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Judging Criteria</h3>\nWinners will be determined based on the following aspects:\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Model Effectiveness and data analysis (40%)\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Your submission will receive a subjective evaluation from the client team.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Model Feasibility (40%)\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>How easy is it to understand your assumptions and analysis?</li>\n\t\t<li>How well your model/approach can be applied to other problems?</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Clarity of the Report (20%)\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Do you explain your proposed method clearly?</li>\n\t\t<li>Are assumptions correct and is documentation clear and precise?</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n&nbsp;<br /><br /><h2>Final Submission Guidelines</h2>Please see

- Hub Application Prototype Challenge","description":"<strong>CHALLENGE OBJECTIVES</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Build the desktop prototype for the Emerald project.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>PROJECT BACKGROUND</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>We need to build a container application where many smaller UI applications can be embedded. Some of these smaller applications may or may not exist today.</li>\n\t<li>For the moment, we&rsquo;re focusing on the container app and the details of the Sentinel UI and Bulk Management apps.</li>\n\t<li>After this prototype is done, we&rsquo;ll move on with API integration.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>TECHNOLOGY STACK</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>ReactJS Latest (v16)</li>\n\t<li>Redux</li>\n\t<li>HTML5</li>\n\t<li>Javascript</li>\n\t<li>CSS</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>API INTEGRATION</strong><br />\nAlthough the API is not ready yet, you need to implement all actions/services required to fetch the data showing in the app from JSON files and storing the data in the Redux store. We should be able to replace the JSON files with actual API calls to integrate the app with the backend without much effort.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nYou must not hardcode any test data into the code.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>SCREEN REQUIREMENTS</strong><br />\nAll screens from the design are in scope of this challenge. We&rsquo;ll provide design source file and the marvelapp link in the forum.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>App Container</strong><br />\nOn this page, only the Bulk Manager UI and Sentinel UI cards are supposed to work, the other UI elements don&rsquo;t have to respond to user actions.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Sentinel Database</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>This page is navigated from App Container page by clicking the Sentinel UI card.</li>\n\t<li>On this page only the Home tab at the top is supposed to work.</li>\n\t<li>Pagination, search, filters above / below the table must work.</li>\n\t<li>Clicking a row will show the read-only details view</li>\n\t<li>Create New and Edit should work.</li>\n\t<li>Please implement field validation error for record creation / editing, as shown in screen #18 of the marvelapp.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Bulk Database</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>This page is navigated from App Container page by clicking the Bulk Manager UI card.</li>\n\t<li>Pagination, search and filters above / below the table must work.</li>\n\t<li>Create New and Edit should work.</li>\n\t<li>Clicking View Batch on a row will navigate to the Batch Database page.</li>\n\t<li>Please implement field validation error for record creation / editing, as shown in screen #18 of the marvelapp.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Batch Database</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>From this page users can navigate back to the Bulk Database page.</li>\n\t<li>Pagination, search and filters above / below the table must work.</li>\n\t<li>Stop must be implemented (simulated) as shown in design.</li>\n\t<li>Create New and Edit should work.</li>\n\t<li>Clicking View Jobs should navigate to the Job Database page.</li>\n\t<li>Please implement field validation error for record creation / editing, as shown in screen #18 of the marvelapp.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Job Database</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>From this page users can navigate back to the Batch Database page.</li>\n\t<li>Pagination, search and filters above / below the table must work.</li>\n\t<li>Stop must be implemented (simulated) as shown in design.</li>\n\t<li>Create New and Edit should work.</li>\n\t<li>On clicking the Refresh button, show the job execution error as shown in screen #17 of the marvelapp. The Resolve Now button will lead to screen #18 of the marvelapp.</li>\n\t<li>The menus must be implemented (screen #19 and #20)</li>\n\t<li>Please implement field validation error for record creation / editing, as shown in screen #18 of the marvelapp.</li>\n\t<li>Sections in the menu popup (scree #20) must be expandable and collapsible.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>GENERAL REQUIREMENTS</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Must use ReactJS and follow the provided design.</li>\n\t<li>The main content should have fluid width to fill all the available space, the minimum supported resolution is 1280*720 (height is actually unlimited since page can scroll).</li>\n\t<li>Searching / filtering should work whenever applicable.</li>\n\t<li>Pagination should work whenever applicable.</li>\n\t<li>Filtering/pagination happens on the server side so you need to pass the query parameters and the server is expected to return the pagination info (pageSize, total etc).</li>\n\t<li>Implement popup for confirmation and warning messages. Do NOT use browser alerts, but use custom styles popups as shown in the design</li>\n\t<li>Show loading spinners when populating data from API / local JSON to UI</li>\n\t<li>Implement validation errors (for example: login error as shown in design)</li>\n\t<li>No linting errors</li>\n\t<li>No errors with prod builds</li>\n\t<li>You are expected to create a detailed README file including information on how to setup, run and verify your application.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>CODE REQUIREMENTS</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>ES6 syntax is preferred, as Babel has been setup to handle transpiling the syntax to the current JavaScript standard.</li>\n\t<li>Use .jsx extension for React components; using PascalCase for filenames. E.g., ComponentName/index.jsx.</li>\n\t<li>Do not create a single .css/.scss file for the whole app. Each component should have its own stylesheet file.</li>\n\t<li>Ensure that there are no lint errors.</li>\n\t<li>You&rsquo;re free to choose between CSS &amp; SCSS but you need to use flex instead of float.</li>\n\t<li>Follow a clean folder structure.</li>\n\t<li>Create reusable components.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>JAVASCRIPT REQUIREMENTS</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>All JavaScript must not have a copyright by a third party. You are encouraged to use your own scripts, or scripts that are free, publicly available and do not have copyright statements or author recognition requirements anywhere in the code.</li>\n\t<li>Use typescript and linter for code quality</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>LICENSES &amp; ATTRIBUTION</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Third-party assets used to build your item must be properly licensed and free for commercial use.

Topcoder Plataform - Final Fixes to Legacy Migration Script","description":"<h2><strong>Challenge Objective</strong></h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Add date parameter to the script and save last run date</li>\n\t<li>���Add challenge type table</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Topcoder has developed a series of new APIs to better support all of their web sites and systems</li>\n\t<li>These new APIs make up the version 5 API</li>\n\t<li>Most of these APIs make use of Elastic Search for their GET calls to speed up searching the data</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\n<strong>Technology Framework</strong></h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Node.js</li>\n\t<li>Elastic Search</li>\n\t<li>DynamoDB</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Requirements</strong></h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Update the legacy migration script code to add a date parameter to the script. The time the script was executed should be stored in DynamoDB (ChallengeHistory table). The idea&nbsp;is avoid pulling the entire challenges everytime we run the script.</li>\n\t<li>This date parameter should be used to fetch challenges and resources where the create date is greater than this date.</li>\n\t<li>If no date is passed the script must:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Check the DymanoDB for last run date and use that date</li>\n\t\t<li>If no date exists in DymanoDB throw error and ask for date parameter</li>\n\t\t<li>After running the script the current date should be stored in DynamoDB as the last time the script was executed</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>If date is passed the script must:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Ignore&nbsp;DymanoDB last run date and use the date parameter</li>\n\t\t<li>After running the script the current date should be stored in DynamoDB as the last time the script was executed</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>The DynamoDB should hold the run date and the statistics: how many challenges and resources where added. You should always insert to this DynamoDB table so we have the statistics for each execution. The last run date is the most recent record.</li>\n\t<li>Retry action is not changed</li>\n\t<li>Create ChallengeType table. The idea is to load the challenge types only once (see ResourceRole for example). Should create index in ES and search using ES the same way as ResourceRole.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>ChallengeType records will come from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://api.topcoder.com/v4/challenge-types\">https://api.topcoder.com/v4/challenge-types</a>:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>The ID in the response should be converted to <strong>legacyId</strong> property and ID in record stored in DynamoDB should be auto-generated</li>\n\t\t<li>Update the challenge migration script to search for the challenge type using&nbsp;<strong>legacyId&nbsp;</strong>in DynamoDB and store in Challenge table the id generated above (see ResourceRole for example)</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Challenge type mapping in configuration file should not be used anymore</li>\n\t<li>Update the create and drop scripts to create/drop ChallengeHistory and&nbsp;ChallengeType tables</li>\n\t<li>Update the view data to view ChallengeHistory and&nbsp;ChallengeType&nbsp;tables</li>\n\t<li>Update the view es data to view&nbsp;ChallengeType data in ES</li>\n\t<li>Legacy migration script code:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li><a href=\"https://github.com/topcoder-platform/legacy-challenge-migration-script/tree/develop\" style=\"padding: 0px;

&hellip;</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Both Tortoise and Rabbit ARPU demonstrate a gradual but steady underlying decline in Average Revenue per User of the 2 years. This is driven by the relative value of those customers acquired compared to those leaving every month - since, on average, the ARPU of customers leaving is higher than both the average customer and the acquired customer, the average ARPU gradually erodes over time.</span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Price Increase impacting as a &lsquo;Level Shift Outlier&rsquo; </strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">in the forecasting of ARPU</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">In Jan &lsquo;18 and Sep &lsquo;18, a price increase was imposed on the existing customer base. This price increase, documented in the privatised data set as a single value in month of impact, introduced a &lsquo;level shift&rsquo; situation into all three ARPU trends.&nbsp; The financial impact of this level shift was then subsequently eroded by the gradual underlying fall in ARPU as described previously.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">This Price Increase would appear to impact over a couple of months, assumed to be due to billing processes employed by the brand.&nbsp; Starting a month before the date of the price increase and building over a couple of months beyond the date of impact.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Isolating this &lsquo;level shift outlier&rsquo; from the underlying trend by removing the price increase gradually from the APRU gives a smoother underlying trend.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/7poUBXtgq0eNfi0ROeJabXdl8NCVgykWS4QYcxnlMdldQJpW9APmbmcsowpVnnXoLiK22qvKfu47sH5BsFUjV5nZ9vkh6ciiYAB4C_O9mYJ-cCAmtUTa9Gfisd4k7pQjaAR46_rp\" style=\"height:407px; margin-left:0px; margin-top:0px; width:624px\" /></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/VrInJ3bV5W_SilOOyq199gI1x-jMiYH_e6iBvaD3Gv_WZ3ETF3TEIvrxRx1GEMQCMVBqnO29X_BQQTIno4sK9zrh4dqD6Xnw3AAAD2NPN1TLhquSrMsg_p3rK3u7xSkuoe6N4nM8\" style=\"height:407px; margin-left:0px; margin-top:0px; width:624px\" /></span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Price increase curve is a suggested &lsquo;line of best fit&rsquo; to gradually introduce the impact of the price increase.&nbsp; When this tempered price increase is removed, the underlying ARPU decline is revealed.</span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">One key objective of this challenge is to build this price increase into the forecast model as a secondary variable as described in the challenge objectives.

We are going to create demo examples for some components for which we don&rsquo;t have a demo page yet in &ldquo;react-components&rdquo;.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:16pt\">Technology Stack</span></h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">React</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">SCSS</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">JavaScript</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">CoffeeScript</span></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:16pt\">Code access</span></h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">- React Components</span><strong> </strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">repo </span><a href=\"https://github.com/appirio-tech/react-components\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">https://github.com/appirio-tech/react-components</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:courier new; font-size:11pt\"> feature/connectv2-dev</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\"> branch</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">- Demo user for </span><a href=\"https://connect.topcoder-dev.com\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Connect App</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">- Config for the file uploading is provided on the forum.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:16pt\">Individual requirements</span></h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Create a demo page that would demonstrate one component </span><a href=\"https://github.com/appirio-tech/react-components/blob/feature/connectv2-dev/components/FilePicker/FilePicker.jsx\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">FilePicker</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">.</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">This page should be accessible by the </span><a href=\"https://monosnap.com/file/uZ9ujinjVzMVMUEaOHjRJxzbHxmLgQ\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-size:11pt\">bottom navigation</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">.

This operation fails and ES returns error like &quot;</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-family:courier new; font-size:11pt\">mapper [array.obj.value] of different type, current_type [long], merged_type [string]</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">&quot;.

There are many kinds of projects that could be chosen as defined by Project Templates. When we choose a different Project Template we see a different form to fill in. Generally, we have 2 types of forms: simple 1-step forms like for &ldquo;</span><a href=\"https://connect.topcoder-dev.com/new-project/chatbot\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Chatbot</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">&rdquo;, and complex multip-step forms aka &ldquo;wizards&rdquo; like &ldquo;</span><a href=\"https://connect.topcoder-dev.com/new-project/talent-as-a-service\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">TaaS</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">&rdquo;.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">When users fill in the forms we always keep the data they entered even when the user leaves the page, we save it to the Local Storage of the browser.

When we create a new project in Project Service we also create a project in another service called Topcoder Direct. Some time ago the code which did so was included in the Project Service source code, but in the new version of Project Service this code to manage Direct projects has been moved to a separate microservice called &ldquo;Topcoder Legacy Project Processor&rdquo;. Also, this new implementation uses direct access to the DB to update Project Service data. This causes some issues so we have to reimplement it &ldquo;Topcoder Legacy Project Processor&rdquo; to use Project Service API.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0);
