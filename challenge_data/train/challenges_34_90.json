color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:16pt\">Challenge Objectives</span></h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Hunt bugs in the provided YAML Config Editor electron app,&nbsp; VSCode extension and webapp.</span></span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\n<span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:16pt\">Project Background</span></h2>\n<span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:14px\">&ldquo;Configuration as code&rdquo; is a technique to store environmental variables, feature flags, and other configuration items in an SCM the same way the code is stored.&nbsp; &nbsp;When the code is deployed,&nbsp; the CI process generates the specific configuration for the proper environment from the config SCM.&nbsp; Then the CD process deploys it to the appropriate hosts alongside the new code.&nbsp; &nbsp;The significant advantage of this approach is that configuration changes are tracked over time which is critical to support.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:14px\">Our client desires to build a configuration tool that allows developers and DevOps a standard and hierarchical approach and intuitive&nbsp; form like User Interface for managing and maintaining complex configuration environments.&nbsp; &nbsp;This tool would be called by the DevOps pipeline to generate JSON configurations for deployment to environments.&nbsp; &nbsp;Spring Cloud Config project will serve as inspiration for this project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:14px\">In this project, we are building a yaml editor, which is&nbsp;hosted by a NodeJS server running in a docker container. When user requests the UI with an HTTP GET request from the browser the NodeJS server (HapiJS) delivers the index.html and all static assets for the Angular application.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the application is running in the browser, the user wants to use it to edit some config files for user&#39;s deployed application.&nbsp;For this the user will need to give a git repo url and login credentials. The app would then send a message back to the NodeJS server to perform a shallow clone (we do not need history here) from the git origin (much the same that Jenkins does when it builds your source code).</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:14px\">Once the repo is cloned the nodejs server can deliver a file list to the browser (only YAML files are delivered, the other files are ignored). The app can either select&nbsp; a file to edit, create a new one, or remove a file. The server either reads (or creates a new file) and sends the content to the browser. And we only need to work with files in the root directory of git repo, no need to support folder for now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:14px\">The app should not work on the master branch of the git repo, it should work on a default &#39;admin&#39; branch.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:14px\">The app then parses the content and allows the user to edit/create properties within the default block, or select properties in the default block to copy to an environment for edit/override, or select an environment from a list of defined environments to add to this config file.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102);

Note that we will provide you the complete requirement documents from the client, and your architecture needs to cover all the requirements (The javascript library and REST API server are not in scope, and everything else is in scope).&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nHere are some brief overview of the requirements. The client has created some interfaces to describe their requirements, but you don&rsquo;t need to follow them exactly, and you should do some necessary refactoring and renaming to ensure it follows the best practice. The only thing that matters is that all requirements are properly addressed.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n1. Create TMOLogger. We will need a factory class as well, just like any java logging framework. It should be implemented as a wrapper of the SLF4J library.<br />\n<img src=\"https://monosnap.com/image/GrZDdwwXfb4irSXyEfeJUKIRS36KqI.png\" style=\"height:260px; width:495px\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n2. Create the TMOLogFormatter. Both XML and JSON implementations should be provided.<br />\n<img src=\"https://monosnap.com/image/SBfCRHAdtFI7rxuAFUpcJ0U2dM5HEO.png\" style=\"height:274px; width:570px\" /><br />\n3. Output Targets<br />\nThe logging library should be able to write records to: Output Stream, System Console, Files, API/Service. Most likely we will just reuse the Appenders from the logging libraries, and add custom Appender implementations if necessary.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nRefer to this library: <a href=\"https://github.com/damiendallimore/SplunkJavaLogging\">https://github.com/damiendallimore/SplunkJavaLogging</a> for a bit more details about logging to Splunk. And the best practice for Splunk integration is to use a Splunk Universal Forwarder(UF) monitoring local log files wherever possible.<br />\n<br />\nSupport the following transport methods:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Splunk forwarder</li>\n\t<li>Syslog</li>\n\t<li>REST API</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n4. Security and Compliance requirements<br />\nIt is imperative to lower exposure by not logging sensitive data or by scrubbing it before it leaves the network.<br />\n<br />\nThe logging library must support this by having &lsquo;compliance&rsquo; parameter built in the configuration. So, that when it is turned on the logger must scrub and in some occasions, not log sensitive data as per following rules.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<img src=\"https://monosnap.com/image/Li6DXvePbxwqPBlf3ay5Cp3lkChgJv.png\" style=\"height:128px; width:602px\" /><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nLogging mechanisms must not allow injection of fake log entries and malicious code. So all data coming from outside the system must be encoded before being logged (e.g. urlencoded). This includes all user input, headers (content- type, referrer, user-agent etc.) and parameters. Typical log injection attacks include, but are not limited to, extra line feed/carriage returns to inject fake log entries and javascript to run when administrators are viewing log entries<br

style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">In this challenge, we are looking for reports discussing when using &ldquo;relay warehouse&rdquo; will lead to a better solution in the vehicle routing problem (VRP) to minimize the total operating cost of trucks for 10 days. You are asked to conduct an analysis based on a small dataset and derive your rules and conclusions.</span>\n\n<h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">This challenge is variation derived from </span><a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/30071082/?type=develop&amp;noncache=true\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">the previous challenge</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\"> we ran.

Each dataset expresses a number of warehouses and the distance between them. The goal of this task is to create accurate, intuitive mathematical formulae to determine when and how to choose relay warehouse(s), in order to minimize the total operation cost minimum in these 5 datasets. You are asked to submit a report about how you have analyzed data and derived the rules and conclusions.</span><br />\n<span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Please note that there could be cases that we do not need any relay warehouse.

To execute these plans, Vulcan is preparing 2 strategic initiatives, which are:<br />\n<br />\n1. Create a &quot;collaboration tool&quot; between Vulcan Technician and Experts. (See the working progress from the following <a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/30076476/?type=design&amp;noncache=true\">RUX48</a> and <a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/30077387/?type=design&amp;noncache=true\">RUX51</a> challenges)<br />\n<br />\n2. Create a &quot;Nerve Center&quot; or command center room in their headquarters, that will monitor, react and predict all things related to IIOT connected devices (assets) within Vulcan factories and plants (We already start the initial work in the <a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/30076921/?type=design&amp;noncache=true\">RUX50</a> challenge)<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Challenge Goals</strong></span><br />\nWe are looking to continue refining and completing the Nerve Center user flow and interactions.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Nerve Center Short Description</strong></span><br />\n- The Nerve center (NC) will become the central intelligence unit for the Vulcan company asset management operation<br />\n- Our Vision for the NC is that it will be connecting and orchestrating the global operations for 100+ plants/factory and 1500+ machines&nbsp;<br />\n- In the beginning, NC will focus on the following:\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">- Enables hyper-speed collaboration among Vulcan Employees and Experts. For example, a Chinese CNC specialist will become available for supporting a solution to a rare CNC problem in Poland in less than 10 minutes. The collaboration will be enhanced by AR and real-time translation technologies<br />\n- Predict and prompt machine failures<br />\n- Captures tacit knowledge and digests it into structured knowledge for the company to learn at a global scale<br />\n- Compares and contrasts asset performance from multiple angles, identifies top performers, elicits what top performers do differently, absorbs and disseminates this knowledge<br />\n- Enables hyper-speed tactical decision making in times of emergency and operational disruptions</div>\n<br />\n<em><strong>Key Concept: </strong>People and Assets (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Internet_of_Things\">IIOT</a> machines) are the key elements of the Nerve Center. We do not want to &quot;drill down&quot; but we want to explode upward from the Asset to understand and tackle issues quickly</em><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>User Personas</strong></span><br />\n<strong>Nerve Center Room (see photos)</strong><br />\n- <strong>Maestro (In-Scope)</strong>, Orchestrates the operational flow in the nerve center with some AI assistance. Works in sync with other Maestros. A Maestro can support 3 activities in parallel.<br />\n<br />\n- <strong>Nerve Center Facilitator (In-Scope)</strong>, On duty employee that see live things happening in the NC. they will funnel Maestro requests and enable work to get done, real-time reacting.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n- <strong>Diagnostics Expert (DE) (out of scope)</strong>, When the maintenance team faces a machine failure and cannot understand its root cause, the DE is the first one to look at the failure. Minimum output expected from him/her is to let the nerve center know what kind of expertise is needed given the diagnosis. It is very likely to have DEs in the nerve center who can trigger SME associations.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Factory Persona&#39;s (In Scope)</strong><br />\n- <strong>Technicians</strong>: Onsite, The technicians work at the plant. They help the DE to understand the problem, follows diagnostics instructions, solves the problem together with the Expert (SME). The Technician sends an SOS if they need assistance (we assume the Technician follows the internal process and gets the required approvals internally in the plant).<br />\n<br />\n- <strong>Subject Matter Expert (SME)</strong>: Onsite or Remote, Has deep vertical expertise on a matter like &#39;software problems in laser cutting machines&#39;. The expertise is defined at least 2 dimensional: asset classes + problem classes. She takes over the problem once the DE has a diagnosis.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Nerve Center Support (Out of Scope)</strong><br />\n- Note we have support roles that help put knowledge into the Nerve Center App - Improving the Nerve Center base knowledge. Potential roles in the support would be:\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">- Data Scientist&nbsp;<br />\n- Data Science Developer<br />\n- Deployment Person (programmer)<br />\n- Training and Quality Expert<br />\n- Technical Exec&nbsp;</div>\n- We left off the descriptions - can provide them if you feel they will help you with your concepts.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Design Consideration</strong></span><br />\n- Need to refine and improve the provided UI<br />\n- Big screen application (follow design best practice for the big screen)&nbsp;<br />\n- Easy to navigate and read information<br />\n- Easy viewing for pages that may be over overcrowded with information<br />\n- Color, shape, icons - the importance of quickly understanding the data<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Challenge Forum</strong></span><br />\nIf you have any doubts or questions regarding challenge requirements, please ask in the challenge forum:<br />\n<a href=\"https://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=ThreadList&amp;forumID=651644\">https://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=ThreadList&amp;forumID=651644</a><br />\n<br />\n~<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Design Requirements</strong></span><br />\nFor this challenge, we are looking for the provided features and interactions to be captured in the Nerve Center as we will want to demo this experience in the future. The screen functionality listed is suggested functionality for consideration. As we are continuing to refine the story please continue to look for design efficiencies in the experience. If there is a better way to accomplish the same goal, then feel free to take creative liberties.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>General Updates</strong><br />\n- We are looking to combine the 1st and 2nd place designs and continue refining the overall Nerve Center GUI and experience. It is up to you as to what you want to use as a base. We will provide design guidance in the forum about <strong>01-271916</strong> and <strong>02-271911</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong><em>Important: </em></strong><em>The GUI needs to be more enterprise/corporate and less &quot;video game&quot;. We still will want the futuristic approach (colors, transparency, shapes) but not all the extra </em><em>graphic</em><em> ornaments.</em><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><br />\n<br />\n- 01-271916 - change all text &quot;Failures&quot; into &quot;Critical&quot;, make sure the data story is correct and consistent across all screens<br />\n- 01-271916 - Prefer to see leads and WIP at the same time, right now the winning design proposed it as a tab which makes it harder to go back and forth between tabs (P5.png and P6.png)<br />\n- Work in progress (WIP) can have parallel activities for a given lane<br />\n- Colors beginning to be very clear/visual guides - Needs to be able to quickly understand the status and also know by shape/icon what something might be. Refer to the (02-271911) - You can see this in the Work in Progress chevrons and the Experts rectangles and the factory diagram - things really stand out!<br />\n- Backlog refers to leads that Maestro decided to take action but has not taken action yet. What you have as the &#39;backlog&#39; are the predefined activities, it is good to keep them, but needs a UX solution.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Maestro Nerve Center Routine Interactions &amp; Workflow</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Assets KPI</strong><br />\n1. The Maestro should be able to quickly see the Asset KPIs at a glance. The KPI&rsquo;s show assets that are vulnerable to having issues, assets that are Off Target, SOS assets and also assets that might be okay but now have an SOS. The Maestro should have the option of being able to use the KPI table as a filter all of the assets on the Nerve Control screen.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Asset Leads</strong><br />\n2. The Maestro will then be able to focus on the Asset Leads to see current issues and potential threats. The Maestro can select an item in this table, and see the Asset Status vitals associated with it and the Asset Logistics which show any recent Asset Work Orders associated with it, if any.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong><em>Definitions:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Asset Work Orders are items being created by the Asset (what does it make in the factory etc.) If an asset is not working it will affect many Work Orders that need to get done using that asset.</em><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Issue Backlog</strong><br />\n3. The Maestro can then make a decision to send any of the Asset Leads to the Issue Backlog or start creating a Work In Progress workflow to be addressed by an Expert and/or Technician. They will base their decision on the urgency of the issue and the production schedule in the Gantt chart. Maestro can also see what experts are available and directly assign them work.<br />\n<br />\n4. In the Issue Backlog screen, they can see the current status of an asset that is waiting to be serviced. Again when an asset in the Backlog screen is highlighted, it&rsquo;s vitals and the current work orders associated with it are visible and easily accessed.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Work in Progress (WIP)</strong><br />\n5. The Maestro can also see the Work in Progress of the various assets, but can select and highlight different sections of the workstream, and can get a detailed view of all the particular tasks within the workstream. Use color codes: Red - Needs to be done, Yellow - In progress, Green - Completed<br />\n<br />\n6.&nbsp; When the Maestro selects and highlights a section of the Work in Progress, it acts as a filter showing the experts who are most qualified and available to fulfill the task. Maestro can choose to assign work to the expert. They can see what else they are currently working on, to make sure they can handle any additional workloads.&nbsp; The expert&rsquo;s schedule should be visible, showing the times and amount of hours they are available.&nbsp; This will be helpful for the Maestro to make a decision on who to assign work.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n7. Include a feature for a progress report that the maestro can access to get an overview of the moves that they have made for the day and see the work progress. They should also be able to see an overall analytics report reflecting long-term performance. (see progress report sample.jpg in the documentation)<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Asset Status&nbsp;</strong><br />\n8. The Asset Status section is important to show the Asset data/reading and the data over time. This helps to track the data and see when anomalies have occurred. Make sure to show a situation in the data when 2 or more anomalies have occurred.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Asset Logistics&nbsp;</strong><br />\n9. The Asset Logistics show the Work order information of a highlighted or selected asset.&nbsp; It gives a more detailed view of the work orders, like if it has been completed.&nbsp; If there is a delay, it will show the reason for the delay.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n10. The Asset Logistics Factory Map shows the routing of the different asset work orders. If the Maestro wants to see a specific WO route he can click on that WO&nbsp; in the Logistics area to highlight it on the Map. Please see the map design in 05-271884 as we thought this was captured well (its not correct) but the visual was done well.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Asset Logistics Gantt Chart</strong><br />\n11. Below is the description of how the Gantt chart should work. The Gantt Chart is available in 01-271916, p5.png and p6.png (at the bottom right of the screen)<br />\n- See Gantt Chart reference from <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14ZAkmSFoI6x1jjkqjrpAtnq9h3d1HRXJ?usp=sharing\">this link</a><br />\n- The Gantt chart should have a timeline with days, shifts, hours and minutes as the smallest unit. Once we have a good Gantt chart, we can focus on how we can tie in commercial and financial KPIs. To illustrate:\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">-- Days &ndash; 24 hours<br />\n-- Shifts &ndash; 8 hours<br />\n-- Hourly tickmarks &ndash; 1 hour<br />\n-- Time &ndash; a minimum unit of time for the whole Gantt. Wos can start at 04:42 and finish at 8:21</div>\n- Plant layouts should end with 2 common assets. Assume these two as packaging and storage. Storage ends with a LINE that shows shipment. We can assume shipment is instantaneous<br />\n- Need a marker that shows the shipment date over the LINE<br />\n- Need marker for the total slack for a given route. Consider all the &lsquo;waiting time&rsquo; through the route plus planned time in storage<br />\n- If a route has 8 hours of wait time and 24 hours of time planned in storage before shipment, we have 32 hours to solve a problem without delaying the shipment<br />\n<br />\n<em><strong>Importance: </strong>What&#39;s important with the G</em><em>antt</em><em> chart is to see the slack/float. For the concept of </em><em>slack/float</em><em> refer to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Float_(project_management)\">this link</a> for more explanation&nbsp;</em><br />\n<br />\n- Slack/float means how much activity can delay without causing delays on the project.<br />\n- Slack/float is basically the total free areas between asset work orders (WO) on the same route including the time in storage.<br />\n- In our production context, float that means how much a WO can wait due to a repair and still do not cause delays in the shipment.<br />\n- Spent less time on the flow of selecting activities and appointing people to an activity<br />\n- Needs to showing dependencies between activities on the Gantt chart. These dependencies can be shown by simple connectors that connect start-finish points of activities. To give more detail, there are 4 types of dependency:<br />\n-- Start to Start &ndash; means two activity should start at the same time<br />\n-- Start to Finish &ndash; First activity cannot start earlier than second finishes (very unusual)<br />\n-- Finish to Start &ndash; second activity cannot start earlier than the first finishes<br />\n-- Finish to Finish &ndash; both finishes together<br />\n-- This dependency is important, it helps us see the route of work orders on the schedule.<br />\n<br />\n~<br />\n<span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong>Important:</strong><br />\n- Keep things consistent.

is a technique to store environmental variables, feature flags, and other configuration items in an SCM the same way the code is stored.&nbsp; &nbsp;When the code is deployed,&nbsp; the CI process generates the specific configuration for the proper environment from the config SCM.&nbsp; Then the CD process deploys it to the appropriate hosts alongside the new code.&nbsp; &nbsp;The significant advantage of this approach is that configuration changes are tracked over time which is critical to support.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:14px\">Our client desires to build a configuration tool that allows developers and DevOps a standard and hierarchical approach and intuitive&nbsp; form like User Interface for managing and maintaining complex configuration environments.&nbsp; &nbsp;This tool would be called by the DevOps pipeline to generate JSON configurations for deployment to environments.&nbsp; &nbsp;Spring Cloud Config project will serve as inspiration for this project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:14px\">In this project, we are building a yaml editor, which is&nbsp;hosted by a NodeJS server running in a docker container. When user requests the UI with an HTTP GET request from the browser the NodeJS server (HapiJS) delivers the index.html and all static assets for the Angular application.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the application is running in the browser, the user wants to use it to edit some config files for user&#39;s deployed application.&nbsp;For this the user will need to give a git repo url and login credentials. The app would then send a message back to the NodeJS server to perform a shallow clone (we do not need history here) from the git origin (much the same that Jenkins does when it builds your source code).</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:14px\">Once the repo is cloned the nodejs server can deliver a file list to the browser (only YAML files are delivered, the other files are ignored). The app can either select&nbsp; a file to edit, create a new one, or remove a file. The server either reads (or creates a new file) and sends the content to the browser. And we only need to work with files in the root directory of git repo, no need to support folder for now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:14px\">The app should not work on the master branch of the git repo, it should work on a default &#39;admin&#39; branch.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:14px\">The app then parses the content and allows the user to edit/create properties within the default block, or select properties in the default block to copy to an environment for edit/override, or select an environment from a list of defined environments to add to this config file.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:source sans pro,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px\">&nbsp;</span>\n\n<h2><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:16pt\">Technology Stack</span></h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">TypeScript</span></span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Git</span></span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Angular 6</span></span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">VSCode Extension</span></span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:source sans pro,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px\">&nbsp;</span>\n\n<h2><strong>Assets</strong></h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Please request access for the gitlab repo</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:source sans pro,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px\">&nbsp;</span>\n\n<h2><strong>What to Test (Scope)</strong>&nbsp;</h2>\n<span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:source sans pro,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:14px\">We previously launched the following challenges to build the YAML Config Editor:</span>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-family:source sans pro,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:14px\">REST API Dev: http://www.topcoder.com/challenge-details/30070171/?type=develop&amp;noncache=true</span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-family:source sans pro,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:14px\">UI Prototype Challenge: http://www.topcoder.com/challenge-details/30070647/?type=develop&amp;noncache=true</span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-family:source sans pro,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:14px\">UI Prototype Update Challenge: http://www.topcoder.com/challenge-details/30070674/?type=develop&amp;noncache=true</span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-family:source sans pro,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:14px\">Bug Fixes</span>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>http://www.topcoder.com/challenge-details/30071175/?type=develop&amp;noncache=true</li>\n\t\t<li>http://www.topcoder.com/challenge-details/30072065/?type=develop&amp;noncache=true</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:source sans pro,arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">You will need to go through all the challenge specifications above to learn about the YAML Config Editor.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:source sans pro,arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">And it has also gone through many private challenges to update the editor app.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nYou should test the</span><strong><span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><span style=\"font-family:source sans pro,arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">vscode </span></span></strong><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:source sans pro,arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">branch, the codebase now has both webapp and vscode extension, please read its README file to see how to&nbsp; build the vscode extension to test.&nbsp;<br />\nYou should also check the features in the webapp are not broken.&nbsp;<br />\nHere is a video show the editor in vscode:&nbsp;</span></span>https://monosnap.com/file/tIaNOQE3rKST80TEvnldt3G8Rqkmm5 , the editor will have the same functionalities as the web page.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:source sans pro,arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Before logging issues, please check the closed issues to see if they are duplicated.&nbsp;</span></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:source sans pro,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px\">&nbsp;</span><br />\n<strong>How to Create New Bug Report</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:source sans pro,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px\">&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:source sans pro,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px\">1.

PDU Mass Commissioning Meteor Javascript App Page and Function Updates Challenge","description":"<strong>Challenge Objectives<br />\n<br />\nApp environment:</strong><br />\n- Meteor Javascript application: <a href=\"https://www.meteor.com/\">https://www.meteor.com/</a><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Basic requirements for this challenge:</strong><br />\n- Continue update desktop native app with Meteor Javascript as the main framework<br />\n- This project use meteor desktop (<a href=\"https://github.com/wojtkowiak/meteor-desktop\">https://github.com/wojtkowiak/meteor-desktop</a>) to build desktop app, meteor desktop grab meteor&#39;s build result for mobile, and wrapped it with electron.<br />\n- Fix some pages based on updated storyboard<br />\n- Pay attention to small details on each page, read instructions below<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Thor PDU Mass Commissioning - Overview</strong><br />\nA PDU (Power Distribution Unit) is a device fitted with multiple outputs designed to distribute electric power, especially to racks of computers and networking equipment located within a data center.&nbsp; The PDU Mass Commissioning tool that we are designing will allow users to create configuration files and networking capabilities for PDUs in a system.&nbsp; The app will allow for the necessary configuration parameters needed for operation within the system.&nbsp; Once all of the configuration parameters have been set within the app, users will be able to &quot;export&quot; the files to a USB drive, which will be plugged into the PDUs to be commissioned.<br />\n<br />\nThe PDU Mass Commissioning tool will be a simple user interface that allows customers to create all of the necessary configuration files to configure all of their PDUs. The app will have a variable number of input fields for all the configuration parameters in which users will enter their desired configurations. Once they have entered all of the configuration parameters they will click &quot;export&quot; and the application will build the configuration file hierarchy into a chosen USB drive.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Technology Stack</strong><br />\n- Meteor Javascript<br />\n- Angular Meteor Integration<br />\n- Meteor desktop (<a href=\"https://github.com/wojtkowiak/meteor-desktop\">https://github.com/wojtkowiak/meteor-desktop</a>)<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Deployment environment requirements</strong><br />\n- Your submission need build as desktop native app that will working on these required OS:<br />\n- Windows<br />\n- Mac OS<br />\n- Linux<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Base of App Updates:</strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/thor-pducomm/meteor-app\">https://gitlab.com/thor-pducomm/meteor-app</a>&nbsp; &gt; Use dev branch<br />\nCheck README.md to help you set up the app. Let us know if you have some questions..<br />\n<br />\n<strong>About PDU Mass Commissioning App</strong><br />\n- PDUs (Power Distribution Units) equipment have several parameters which need to be configured before the first use<br />\n- The Mass commissioning application to be developed aims at expediting&nbsp; the commissioning process in case of large amounts of PDUs to be configured (from 20 to several hundreds of units)<br />\n- Targeted audience: industrial users<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Basic process flow</strong><br />\n- The user defines the value of the configuration parameters he wants to apply to the PDU in the PDU mass deployment Software tool (to be developed during the Topcoder challenge)<br />\n- The different parameters are exported to a standard USB key in the form of pre-defined configuration files (the files naming convention and file hierarchy must be respected)<br />\n- The user plugs the USB flash drive into the PDU(s) to be commissioned<br />\n- The PDU automatically detects the correctly formatted USB flash drive and reconfigures itself with settings found on the USB flash drive<br />\n- Check this Business Process Screen to understand the expected flow: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=123Dwqto2paFbXWUjVgfHEDYpexBSAqTI\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=123Dwqto2paFbXWUjVgfHEDYpexBSAqTI</a><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Submission Requirements</strong><br />\nCurrent application use Date Model JSON Schema when build the layout.

Overview Update</strong><br />\nScreen: Screenshot: 00 Overview@2x.png<br />\n- Add new &lsquo;Start from existing CSV&rsquo; button below the General Setting button<br />\n- This button Import a pre-existing CSV template file (either manually generated or saved by the application during a previous session thanks to the &rdquo;Save Changes&rdquo; button in the UI). This import is currently missing in the prototype and needs to be implemented.<br />\n- Click Start from existing button need load the modal window (Screenshot: 01 Overview - Popup@2x.png)<br />\n- User can select New file and existing file tab<br />\n- Click Browse button need allow user to select the CSV file<br />\n- Re-use existing progress bar inside the modal window on General Settings &gt; Expert mode<br />\n<br />\n<strong>2). Asset Management improvement</strong><br />\nScreenshot: 03 Asset Management_Basic@2x.png<br />\n- Update Asset Management page based on storyboard<br />\n- There&rsquo;s new button for Add Device and Data Entry Wizard<br />\n- So, the new list of asset identification parameters are:<br />\n- BASIC MODE: Rack, Row, Feed, MAC, SN, IP address, Note, Last modified. (Screenshot: 03 Asset Management_Basic@2x.png)<br />\n- EXPERT MODE: Rack, Row, Feed, MAC, SN, PDU Type, IP address, Note, Last modified. (Screenshot: 04 Asset Management_Expert@2x.png)<br />\n- Feed column will contain information will be used by the user to distinguish 2 devices located in the same rack and row. Please note that this free field also corresponds to a parameter in the data model (Power/Environment&rarr;Power ePDU&rarr;Feed name)<br />\n- We need to add a &ldquo;Last modified&rdquo; column which details when the row (=the device) was last modified<br />\n- We need to add a &ldquo;Note&rdquo; column which is a free text editable field used by the user to store some comments/notes<br />\n- Add a sorting option for each column of the wizard in both sorting directions (ascending/descending)<br />\n- Add display per page and pagination to table on Asset Management page<br />\n- Update table font size on Export and After Commissioning to follow table style on Asset Management<br />\n- We need make the left sidebar collapsed (Screenshot: 05 Asset Management_Expert_Collapsed@2x.png)<br />\n- Left sidebar need able to collapse<br />\n- Check how the icon aligned on the left sidebar<br />\n<br />\n<strong>3). Search Function Improvement</strong><br />\nScreenshot: 06 Search@2x.png<br />\n- This is screen when user click Search button on header bar<br />\n- Click search button on header bar need replace title on top<br />\n- This will search Asset management table<br />\n- Type keyword then click search need load this screen (Screenshot: 07 Search Results@2x.png)<br />\n- This is when user click Advanced Search on the right side (Screenshot: 08 Advanced Search@2x.png)<br />\n- Need able to change dropdown to to some existing table column<br />\n- Need able to add field to specify each field<br />\n- The current search function in the wizard looks good but is limited to a few parameters only (the ones used for the basic asset identification such as MAC address, Serial number, etc&hellip;).<br />\n- We would like to have one more search option which applies to all the fields of the wizard.<br />\n- Also, we would like to implement a smarter search function using some Booleans (AND, OR) (for instance, searching all the devices having an IP address including 186.10 AND located in row 1)<br />\n<br />\n<strong>6). Firmware Upgrade on selected devices</strong><br />\nScreenshot: 09 Firmware Upgrade@2x.png<br />\n- A single or multiple firmware image versions can be selected in the General section. However, the current application prototype does not allow yet to assign a particular firmware version to a selected device or group of devices. &nbsp;<br />\n- This capability needs to be added in the &ldquo;System settings&rdquo; screen in the form of a scroll-down menu the user first selects a firmware image version and then decide to apply it to the selected device(s).<br />\n- As a result, this information will be used during the configuration files export process to associate the right firmware image version to the corresponding device thanks to the specific &ldquo;Upgrade.txt&rdquo; JSON text file:<br />\nThe &quot;Upgrade.txt&quot; file is an optional JSON file.<br />\nIt allows to force a firmware upgrade during the Mass commissioning.<br />\nThe PDU has to parse the &quot;Upgrade.txt&quot; file to get the name of the binary upgrade file: &nbsp;<br />\n?<br />\n{<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;version&quot;: &quot;0001&quot;,<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;filename&quot;: &quot;Image_ePDUG3_FW_03_01_0002.bin&quot;<br />\n}<br />\n<br />\n<strong>7). Export sequence</strong><br />\nScreenshot: 10 Export Steps@2x.png<br />\n- When exporting the XML configuration files on the USB flash drive, the drive needs to be erased first (we need to make sure to start from a blank media)<br />\n- The complete export sequence specification including the required security measures is detailed in below document: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UwjgnH0J18tCG8CHmPTWCI45TLc17EzJ<br />\n<br />\n<strong>8). Data Entry Wizard</strong><br />\nScreenshot: 11 Data Entry Wizard@2x.png<br />\n- User click Data Entry Wizard button then need load this screen<br />\n- On the right side user can add some parameters to generate the table<br />\n- Right now Device table load from external file when user open the app by default<br />\n- We need to have a &ldquo;data entry mode&rdquo; for the device table, where a user could do something like this:<br />\n1) Define and generate a number of rows in the table<br />\n2) Manually populate the row, rack, and feed by navigating with up/down arrows. &nbsp;<br />\n3) Go into data entry mode where the user can enter one serial number or MAC address at a time simply going down the table and pressing enter after one serial number or MAC address will go to the next device and be ready to enter the serial number or MAC.&nbsp; This would be compatible with someone using a barcode reader to scan the data on one PDU after another, according to the row/rack/feed that is already populated in the table.<br />\n- Note: By default, selecting a cell in the wizard should lead to the complete selection of the cell<br />\n<br />\nWizard Clone function<br />\n- A basic &ldquo;clone&rdquo; function is needed in the wizard to be able to clone a row and its associated parameters.<br />\n- The only parameters which DO NOT need to be cloned are SN and MAC fields in order to make sure each device/row stays unique.<br />\n<br />\nPDU Type<br />\n- If the EXPERT mode is selected, the default wizard content includes the PDU type information column.<br />\n- 4 different choices are possible for the PDU type information: MI/IL, MO, SW, MA<br />\n- The implementation of a scroll-down menu to select any of these types is requested<br />\n- This PDU type information will be used in the expert mode to select only the relevant parameters that we want to be available to the user (this dependency is detailed in the JSON data model that we provide)<br />\n<br />\nWizard columns: Hide/Show<br />\nWe would like to implement a Hide/Show function for the columns of the device asset table (for instance, if the user only uses the MAC address to identify its devices, he could save some space by hiding the SN column)<br />\n<br />\nScreenshot: 16 Multiple Outlets management@2x.png<br />\n<br />\n<strong>9). After Commissioning Update</strong><br />\n- On this screen, we need remove some element:<br />\n- Remove Export to USB button<br />\n- Remove Configuration file button<br />\n- Then, the app also needs to propose to open the Log.csv file present on the key with any of the viewer available on the OS &nbsp;<br />\n- IMPORTANT: for safety reasons, the app needs to propose to erase the USB drive content. How the message look. Screenshot: 12 After Commissioning@2x.png<br />\n- When the Mass Configuration finishes, the PDU writes the result of the process in this file.<br />\nFor example, after parsing 3 ePDUs the result could be like on screenshot<br />\n- This screen show up after the warning modal window: Screenshot: 13 After Commissioning &ndash; Logfile@2x.png<br />\n- There are option to select Restore Old Config and delete button (Screenshot: 14 After Commissioning &ndash; Options@2x.png)<br />\n- This when expand the right sidebar: - Screenshot: 16 Multiple Outlets management@2x.png<br />\n- We need make ability to expand and collapse left and right sidebar<br />\n<br />\n<strong>10). Application Library Style Update</strong><br />\nOur application need optimize the usage of these libraries:<br />\n<br />\nPX Blue Themes<br />\n- GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/pxblue/themes\">https://github.com/pxblue/themes</a><br />\n<br />\nPX Blue Colors<br />\n- GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/pxblue/colors\">https://github.com/pxblue/colors</a><br />\n<br />\nPX Blue Icons / Icon Font<br />\n- GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/pxblue/icons\">https://github.com/pxblue/icons</a><br />\n<br />\n<strong>11). General UI Updates</strong><br />\n- Abbreviate the following menu items:&nbsp; &rsquo;System&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;System settings&rsquo;, &lsquo;Network&lsquo; instead of &lsquo;Network infrastructure&rsquo;<br />\n- Home icon should be filled, material design theme<br />\n- On the right side of Asset Management, when the wizard is collapsed, it is requested to have only one category and one field per line<br />\n- To decrease the complexity of the project, we have decided to remove the &ldquo;Branch circuit&rdquo; and &ldquo;Outlets&rdquo; from the Data model<br />\n- This is for development, all content on the right sidebar need collapsed by default<br />\n- In view of anticipating the future monetization of the application, it is requested to implement an internal persistent variable which counts the number of devices to be configured.<br />\n- This counter will be later used in combination with a manual license activation to monetize the application based on the number of devices to be commissioned.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>12). Icon and Splash screen</strong><br />\nIcon: Icons@2x.png<br />\nSplash Screen: Splash Screen@2x.png<br />\n- This icon need show up when launching as desktop native app<br />\n- Show progress bar to load all the application assets<br />\n- Follow the animation about the gear (not with the holes) rotating on screen.<br /><br /><h2>Final Submission Guidelines</h2><strong>Deliverables</strong><br

This RUX is a follow-up challenge to the recently completed challenge to create a &ldquo;Collaboration Tool&rdquo; for the Vulcan company. In this RUX challenge, we are looking for your help to refine, completing missing screens/features/interactions, combine and clean up the different design elements based on the provided winning designs, and the latest client requirements for the application. This challenge is focused on creating one solid application design that provides well-organized information architecture and clean navigation for the user to have a seamless experience.<br />\n<br />\nLet us know if you have any questions!<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>What is a RUX Challenge?</strong></span><br />\nThe RUX (Rapid User Experience) challenge uses the same format as our famous LUX Challenge except it is not &quot;Live&quot; at an event. The RUX Challenge Series provides you with an opportunity to show digital leaders from some of the largest companies in the world just how good your concept and user experience (UI/UX) design skills are.<br />\n<br />\nRUX (Rapid User Experience) challenges are fast, fun, and have more chances for you to capture prize money!<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#008000\"><em>Note: You do not need to have RUX challenge experience to join this challenge - Just jump in and give it a try!

To execute these plans, Vulcan is preparing 2 strategic initiatives, which are:<br />\n<br />\n1. Create a &quot;collaboration tool&quot; between Vulcan Technicians and Experts which was recently started via <a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/30076476/?type=design&amp;noncache=true\">This RUX challenge</a><br />\n<br />\n2. Create a &quot;Nerve Center&quot; or command center room in their headquarters, that will monitor, react and predict all things related to IIOT connected devices (assets) within Vulcan factories and plants which was recently run via <a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/30076921/?type=design&amp;noncache=true\">This RUX challenge</a> (in Review Phase)<br />\n<br />\nIn this challenge, we want to continue to refine, update and improve the &quot;collaboration story&quot; and design the screens and interactions between Technician and Experts. We are looking to:<br />\n1. Complete the flow (include any missing features)<br />\n2. Continue refining the UI<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>RUX Challenge Timeline and Rolling Checkpoint</strong></span><br />\n- Submission Start: <strong>Tuesday, 18th December 2018 at 23:00 PM EST</strong><br />\n- Rolling Checkpoint Start: <strong>Thursday, 20th December 2018 at 11:00 AM EST</strong><br />\n- Submission End: <strong>Friday, 21st December 2018 at 23:00 PM EST</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Note: Important Rolling Checkpoint Details</strong><br />\n- High-Def and adroc will answer questions and provide Rolling Feedback as fast as possible<br />\n- You must watch the Forum for your feedback!<br />\n- All initial qualifying checkpoint submissions will win $50 (Only 8 potential submissions)<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Challenge Goal</strong></span><br />\nContinue to refine the UI and completing screen interactions between Technician and Expert in the &quot;collaboration tool&quot;, in order to facilitate access communication between those two roles and speed up the process of fixing machine issues<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Challenge Forum</strong></span><br />\nPlease ask in challenge forum for any doubts/questions regarding challenge requirements:<br />\n<a href=\"https://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=ThreadList&amp;forumID=651018&amp;mc=4\">https://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=ThreadList&amp;forumID=651018&amp;mc=4</a>&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>User Personas</strong></span><br />\n<strong>1. Factory Maintenance Technician&nbsp;</strong><br />\n- Machine &quot;fixers&quot; who need their hands free to perform their jobs. They wear an AR headset (we will use the Realwear glasses product) which acts as a HUD (heads up display) that provides necessary information and data on the machinery. They need their hands free to operate and fix the machines. The Factory Technician will be reaching out and asking for assistance from the expert network as part of this collaboration tool.<br />\n- AR realwear Headset (<a href=\"https://www.realwear.com/\">https://www.realwear.com/</a>) is a hands-free tool based on an Android OS for industrial workers.&nbsp; It is head-mounted to improve the efficiency and productivity of mobile workers in hazardous environments. See <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t2gw1qoH8lViM6EWwj4Q_Z8KADDuVpK0/view\">this link</a> for the glasses detail information.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>2. Machine/Technical Experts&nbsp;</strong><br />\n- Our company experts, who work globally and remotely away from the factories that they monitor. They are there to support the Technicians with any machine issues. The devices they use is primarily tablets (as they will be mobile).&nbsp;<br />\n- This collaboration tool will look to &quot;assign the best talent and available talent&quot; to the situation. They can be anywhere in the world so the collaboration tool will also provide a real-time voice translation. The experts might use different language from the Technician but the collaboration tools should have the capability to translate the language in real time for both of them. See <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQVQVt5H2QM\">this video</a> to get more ideas/information about the real-time voice translation.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE: Vulcan has upwards of 150 factories around the world, a Technician who receives help today can be an expert that is helping someone else tomorrow. This is an important contextual element and key to &quot;collaboration&quot;. It is important because an expert has their own routine and work within the factory they support.</strong><br />\n<br />\n~<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Screen Requirements and Refinements</strong></span><br />\nFor this challenge, we are looking for the provided &quot;user story&quot; to be captured as we will want to demo this experience (between the Technician and the Expert) in the future. The screen functionality listed is suggested functionality for consideration. As we are continuing to refine the story please continue to look for design efficiencies in the experience. If there is a better way to accomplish the same goal, then feel free to take creative liberties.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Glasses</strong><br />\n<strong>01) Technician Assignment</strong><br />\n1. The Technician will log into the system using the AR glasses (by scanning his ID card or via Voice authentication). They are aware they need to check an asset or see about available Work Orders (WO) planned for Technician&rsquo;s undertaking.<br />\n<br />\n2. The Technician will need to prompt/use the voice command to call their dashboard (&ldquo;Show me Dashboard&rdquo;, &ldquo;Show me Work Orders&rdquo;) - it needs to be arranged to have a good fit for the AR Glasses (more visibility and less visual blocks than the current design(s), Technician). The Technician by default will error on the side of visibility in their glasses.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong><em>*Design Note: Many of the designs in the first challenge covered a lot of the main focus/viewing area&hellip; work to improve this and look to see what &quot;actions&quot; or interactions can be called by voice.&nbsp;</em></strong><br />\n<br />\n3. The Technician can see if there are any immediate Work Orders (WO) for himself so they can go to that asset and start work. Usually, WOs have a schedule. If they grab a WO it will provide them the Asset information, location, issue etc. The Technician is able to start to diagnose the issue as they are on their way to check on it.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong><em>*Design Note: Work Order items are listed based on impact. The Technician will walk to the asset and deal with the situation. A WO might go for a few days. More than one technician can be doing the work in their respective shifts for long WOs, like a relay race.</em></strong><br />\n<br />\nWO Status<br />\n- In Progress<br />\n- Completed<br />\n- Assigned<br />\n- Status of parts and impact on status of WO.<br />\n<br />\n4. Need to see a factory view that shows items that have work orders.&nbsp; also allows the tech to ask for directions to the machine that needs fixing.<br />\n<br />\n5. Voice Search: In a typical plant/factory, there might be 400 assets available there, so voice search is needed, for example: Voice command: &quot;Milling&quot;, then continue with another Voice command: &quot;status vulnerable&quot; (it would filter milling machines of which status is &#39;vulnerable&#39;) - Voice commands should be displayed back to the glasses user, this will ensure they are captured properly.<br />\n<br />\nSamples:<br />\nVoice command - up / down, or search: &#39;current&#39;<br />\nVoice command - &#39;Last 50 hours&#39; &ndash; shows the time series for only the last 50 hours<br />\nVoice command - &#39;anomalies only&#39;. &ndash; filters sensor series with anomalies in the last 50 hours<br />\nVoice command &ndash; &#39;correlation&#39; - calculates whether some sensor readings have strong correlation and activates the ones with strong correlation<br />\nVoice command &ndash; &#39;only strongly correlated&#39; - filters everything else<br />\nVoice command - &#39;anomalies more than 1 standard deviations&#39;<br />\n<br />\n6. Recording: Recording Features - Ability to start/stop recording and documenting issue when start fixing the Asset&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n7. A Technician can also scan an Asset in the factory to see current status, any Work Orders and subscribe to it take the immediate WO.<br />\n<br />\n8. If there is problem that happens when a Technician is on duty and there is no assignment created yet, the Technician can create the Work Order by themselves.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>02) Analyzing Assets</strong><br />\nAn asset here can be a Machine, Robot, Workstation, etc.<br />\n<br />\n1. The Technician will need to connect to the Asset first by scanning barcode OR selecting the asset from collaboration tool database (choose/search from Asset list). Then technician sees the Asset Hierarchy for the selected asset. Asset Hierarchy refers to the components/sub-components/sub-components&hellip; is organized for an Asset.<br />\n<br />\n<strong><em>*Design Note: We will mention the Asset Hierarchy a lot here. This is a missing interaction(s) that we want to capture. &quot;Asset Insights&quot;. This view may be captured in a couple of locations. The Technician can see all Assets or they will see how the Asset they are checking on fits in that hierarchy. We currently see this being designed in a tree structure. (see Complex-Assets.png)</em></strong><br />\n<br />\nAsset Hierarchy View<br />\n- Important to capture Assets (their hierarchy) and time series data. This view is insightful if it can show a link among 2-3 abnormal sensor readings.<br />\n<br />\nScenario<br />\n- Current (amp) spiked like 50%<br />\n- 3 seconds later the oil temperature starts to increase steadily for 120 seconds<br />\n- In this 120 seconds &#39;wear metal particles&#39; sensor reading increases rapidly (this actually means some mechanical problem with the gears)<br />\n- At the end machine gave an error and shut down.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nIf the UI can connect these 3 events, the Technician asks &#39;select gearbox&#39;, they see the gearbox 3D CAD and associated sensor data (hours since last maintenance etc.)<br />\n<br />\n2. The Technician is able to see all of the Asset details, Asset hierarchy, work orders, previous history, drill into the asset details.<br />\n- Asset Details<br />\n- Asset History<br />\n- Parameters<br />\n- Diagnostics<br />\n- Status: Vulnerable, Critical, Stable<br />\n<br />\nThinking this might be 4 Tabs: Asset, Asset History, Parameters, Diagnostics<br />\n<br />\n<strong><em>*Design Note: What is a good interaction of calling up a lot of information? We need to maximize the Technicians cognitive effectiveness, especially working memory. So, going back and forth between screens/tabs might not be the best solution. Also, we need technicians glass view as open as possible, due to safety concerns.</em></strong><br />\n<br />\n3. The Technician is able to see a thermal imaging view of the Asset (see attachments)<br />\n<br />\n<strong>03) Asset Detail and Drill-in</strong><br />\nAfter the Technician has checked on on the asset they will want to see additional information and drill into the Asset details to figure out what is wrong/how to fix the issue. Essentially they will be doing a much &quot;self-help&quot; if possible.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n1. To open the asset details, the Technician needs to use Voice command like &quot;Open CAD&quot; or &quot;Open Blueprint&quot;.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n2. The Asset Hierarchy would be visible to the Technician.<br />\n<br />\n3. Technician see&#39;s the documentation dashboard and listed blueprint/CAD documents<br />\n<br />\n4. Some of the most frequent failure types can be shown with the CAD drawing. Because we are narrowing the culprits. Showing &quot;common issues&quot;<br />\n<br />\n5. Technician is able to drill into the documents, zoom into the CAD/Blueprint files to find the item they are looking for. Voice command is critical here.<br />\n<br />\n<strong><em>*Design Note: Focus on the user - &quot;Safety First&quot; on how they will be viewing/using this feature while in the factory.</em></strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>04) Request Help</strong><br />\nThe Technician is unable to find or solve the problem OR they need immediate help &quot;SOS&quot;<br />\n<br />\n1. The Technician asks for help - voice command<br />\n<br />\n2. Provide an ability to ask for help - it can be done via two ways:&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nFind Expert<br />\n- Find the expert directly is available in the system via the collaboration tool database.<br />\n- Show the list of Experts and see their profile before connecting to them&nbsp;<br />\n- Find Experts algorithm should be based on (Skill + Location + Availability + Rating + Cost Per Hour + Experience with the Asset or similar problem classes).&nbsp;<br />\n- No need to show Experts who are not available (no use for that).&nbsp;<br />\n- A Technician might select a different expert if they know that expert will be available in an hour (so reasonable availability).<br />\n- Most important is, the Experts should have status &#39;has worked on this machine before&#39;<br />\n- The Technician, with the help of Nerve Center or Choose the Expert directly, will be able to setup a &#39;collaboration session&#39; with the selected Expert to get the problem fixed<br />\n<br />\nSOS Alert<br />\n- Send SOS to the Nerve Center so they can analyze the problem and find a solution from the Nerve Center base knowledge or put in a request to an Expert.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>05) Technician &amp; Experts Collaboration</strong><br />\n- We want to capture the flow of how the Technician and Experts are collaborating.<br />\n<br />\n<strong><em>*Design Note: Keep the names, assets, expert consistent throughout your screens</em></strong><br />\n<br />\n- In the &#39;collaboration session&#39; provide a feature that if the recording has not started yet (Technician does not activate the features when he starts doing the assignment), the Tool will record the call automatically to create an archive/transcript that will be saved and sent to the Nerve Center for future improvements.<br />\n<br />\nTechnician (Glasses)<br />\n1. Technician (no need to see the Experts face) - has to see what the Experts is seeing on the screen&nbsp; - However, if necessary, Technician should also able to call &quot;show me expert&quot; to pull up the video of the expert, maybe the expert needs to show a part<br />\n<br />\n2. Show conversation features between Technician and Alex - Real Time Voice Translation (show audio and text translation)<br />\n<br />\n3. Show the collaboration tool &quot;AR&quot; where they are working together to view a 3D diagram of the machine.<br />\n<br />\n4. Show the collaboration tool where the Expert is drawing and pointing on the screen, Expert is coding/making updates to the Asset, sharing documents.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n5. Show the issues being resolved where Technician provides verbal feedback/notes on the issues and what was solved. (These notes and video show up later in the support areas)<br />\n<br />\nExperts (Tablet)<br />\n<strong><em>*Challenge Note:&nbsp; the priority in this challenge is Technician flow (and interactions with the Expert). Look to refine the Glasses view as much as possible.</em></strong><br />\n<br />\n1. The Experts will be able to login and see his dashboard via tablet device<br />\n- The Experts should be able to see missed calls and ability to called back<br />\n<br />\n2. Experts should be able to perform this Asset Maintenance/Fixing Attempts from his tablet (and Technician can see it):<br />\n- Get pictures/video of the asset - Need to see more than 1 side of an asset at the same time.<br />\n- See Blueprints, CAD, 3D images<br />\n- The ability to upload the Asset schematic and then the Technician can see it (blueprint, image of a part, instruction manual, etc)&nbsp;<br />\n- Show Asset Details Information (See sensor readings, filter, sort - See asset hierarchy - See 3D CAD models of the components of the asset hierarchy)<br />\n- Ability to Remote Connect to the Machines - Remote access to machine CLI or Remote access to a laptop with access to machine CLI<br />\n- Show Suggestions (from the Nerve Center)<br />\n- Read the Asset manual document<br />\n- Follow the available module to fix issue (based on log history or from maintenance work instructions)<br />\n- Drawing on the screen by the Expert - including Drag and drop to the Technician video/screen<br />\n- Upload video<br />\n- Show previous incident reports (See maintenance/repair history)<br />\n- Capture WO wrap up questions: Captured verbally by both the Technician and the Expert<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Multiple Experts Scenario</strong>, needs to provide collaboration session to be elaborated with screen sharing, 2 Experts + 1 Technician, remote access to machine CLI - If for some reason, the current Experts can&#39;t solve the Asset problem (less knowledge, called disconnected, etc), Technician can request another Experts to join the call and collaborate to fix the Asset problems (so the other experts can learn too)<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Marvel Prototype</strong></span><br />\n- We need you to upload your screens to Marvel App.<br />\n- Please send your marvel app request to fajar.mln@gmail.com (Challenge Copilot)&nbsp;<br />\n- You MUST include your Marvel app URL (in your marvel app prototype, click on share and then copy the link &amp; share it with your notes/comment this link while you upload).<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Video References</strong></span><br />\n- Real Time Voice Translation: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQVQVt5H2QM\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQVQVt5H2QM</a><br />\n- How Voice Control Works in glasses: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ddPN7a9fk\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ddPN7a9fk</a><br />\n- Sample video of Collaboration between Technician and Expert: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mvjf8VOKZy4\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mvjf8VOKZy4</a><br />\n- RealWear Glasses demo:&nbsp;<br />\n-- <a href=\"https://www.realwear.com/rw/hmt-1-featured-in-honeywell-video/\">https://www.realwear.com/rw/hmt-1-featured-in-honeywell-video/</a><br />\n-- <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGBgBFkQuFE\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGBgBFkQuFE</a><br />\n-- <a href=\"https://iqagent.com/realwear/\">https://iqagent.com/realwear/</a><br />\n-- <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNW842zldlo\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNW842zldlo</a><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Previous RUX Design</strong></span><br />\n- We are providing the screen designs from the previous RUX<br />\n- Use them as inspiration for where we want to continue to evolve the UI<br />\n- Color is very important!

recursive code works for things like embedded markdown and the MIME handling for images.&nbsp; &nbsp;You are also required to document the file structure, including which Javascript files are required for Markdown and what each individual file contains in terms of functionality.<br />\n<br />\nFinally, you should include at least one sequence diagram in your submission to show the flow of markdown

RCS Angular Prototype Challenge #2","description":"<strong>Project Background</strong><br />\nRCS is an Asset Reliability Centered Business Performance Tool, specifically designed for Power Grids and Substations asset reliability management. For this project, we are going to run a series of prototype challenges to build a web based UI for the tool.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Challenge Objectives</strong><br />\nIn the previous challenge we have implemented part 1 of the prototype, but since then the design has evolved quite a bit. The purpose of this challenge is to update the previous prototype to match the latest design.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Technology Stack</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>AngularJS 6</li>\n\t<li>Bootstrap 4</li>\n\t<li>HTML 5</li>\n\t<li>Javascript</li>\n\t<li>CSS</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>API Integration</strong><br />\nAlthough the API is not ready yet, you need to implement simple controllers / services to fetch the data showing in the app from JSON files. We should be able to replace the JSON files with actual API calls to integrate the app with the backend without much effort so hard coded data is not acceptable.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nWe are going to share JSON format with dummy data with details on which JSON is for which screen, you should use that as base.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Page Requirements</strong><br />\nRegister to download full spec from challenge forum that contains screenshots.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Important Requirements</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Bootstrap 4 should be used</li>\n\t<li>Prototype should use configurable field names and validation messages (Key and Values are Defined in JSON file)</li>\n\t<li>Properly implement internationalization-i18n. Please define the mechanism and provide all resources in English. Make all messages, labels, etc configurable</li>\n\t<li>Implement field level validation (error message should be displayed below the mandatory fields)</li>\n\t<li>Show loading spinners when populating data from API / local service to UI</li>\n\t<li>Implement popup for confirmation and warning messages. Do NOT use browser alerts, but use custom styles popups like the ones we have in the prototype</li>\n\t<li>The base prototype implements password protection on all pages, do NOT break that</li>\n\t<li>No linting errors</li>\n\t<li>No errors with prod builds</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>General Requirements</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Must use Angular 6 and follow the provided design.</li>\n\t<li>The main content should have fluid width to fill all available space.</li>\n\t<li>Pagination should work whenever applicable.</li>\n\t<li>Must follow Angular best coding practices</li>\n\t<li>You are expected to create a detailed README file including information on how to setup, run and verify your application.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>HTML Requirements</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>HTML should be valid HTML5 compliant.</li>\n\t<li>Provide comments on the page elements to give clear explanation of the code usage.

- Data Parsing Challenge","description":"<strong>Challenge Detail</strong><br />\nAs part of earlier challenges we gathered a set of paragraphs from multiple sources. The goal of this challenge is to parse those text paragraphs of data to find keywords specific to our needs.<br />\n<br />\nDetails you need to parse<br />\n1. If the vaccine is mandatory for the college. Vaccines can be Mandatory or Voluntary. The parser should be able to identify the same.&nbsp;<br />\n2. There is a list of specific keywords (mentioned in forum) which you would need to correctly identify and parse.<br />\n3. The output of your code should be a CSV file. Format is mentioned in the forum.<br />\n4. The code must be in Python.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Project Background</strong><br />\nCustomer is a global healthcare company, they research, develop and manufacture consumer healthcare products. The purpose of this project to help find the universities and colleges that have the mandatory Seasonal Flu vaccination and also find universities/colleges that just recommend it.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Technology Stack</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Python 3.6</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Individual Requirements</strong><br />\n<br />\n<u>Challenge Input</u><br />\nWe ran few challenges previously to extract the list of colleges and specific information based on keywords from the URLs.&nbsp; The code is shared in the forums. Also an expected format for data parsing is provided as csv file in the forums.<br />\n<br />\n<u>Scope</u>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Run the existing project to parse the data and load it to the DB.</li>\n\t<li>Using natural language processing or any other parsing logic, generate the CSV file for the list of colleges based on the template provided.

an AWS EC2 instance</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Project Background</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>CMAP Scorer is a Nodejs (version 10) based app that scores submissions by running tests on it.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The tests are run on the submission inside a docker container. The app itself is not run inside docker, only the scoring engine is present in a docker container, which is used to score the submission. <s>It is executed using the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/docker-compose\">docker-compose nodejs module</a>.</s>&nbsp;We use a child process to execute docker compose</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Technology Stack</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Nodejs (version 10)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Kafka (version 2). The app listens to kafka messages.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Docker and Docker Compose</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p>For this contest, in addition to the above:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Gitlab&rsquo;s CI/ CD with Gitlab Runner</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>AWS EC2</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>(Optional) AWS CodeDeploy or any other tool within the AWS Ecosystem</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Code access</strong></p>\n\n<p>For this contest, we will not be sharing the code base with you. Instead, you could use a general Nodejs based code base hosted on gitlab.</p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p>Our code is similar to the the <a href=\"https://github.com/topcoder-platform/aggregate-scorer\">Aggregate scorer</a>, except we also have additional code to start a docker instance to run the scoring engine. Also, our code is hosted on Gitlab and not Github, unlike the aggregate scorer.</p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p>Since we are not sharing the source code, we will review your solution using the details shared in this contest itself and not fail your solution for anything that was not mentioned in this specification. If there&rsquo;s any confusion or doubt, please clarify in the contest forum.</p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Individual requirements</strong></p>\n\n<p><u>Setup auto deployment of app</u></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The app is hosted in gitlab.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Use gitlab based CI / CD runner to deploy a specific branch (let&rsquo;s call the branch name f2f for now) to AWS EC2 when there is a commit to this branch. Ensure that the app is gracefully restarted in EC2 on each deploy.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Before deploying, run the npm run lint command to check for lint errors. If there are no errors, proceed with the deployment else stop.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>In addition to the Gitlab CI / CD runner, you can optionally use AWS CodeDeploy or any other tool within the AWS ecosystem to deploy the app to EC2</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Don&rsquo;t use docker to deploy. As in, don&rsquo;t dockerize the app to deploy to EC2. This is because the app itself starts a docker instance for the scoring engine.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Our current deployment step, locally, is</p>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>Run npm install</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>Set the environment variables as needed</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>Run npm start. That&rsquo;s it.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Deployment guide and validation document</p>\n\n<p>Share a DEPLOYMENT.md file or a Word document that describes the setup needed for using your gitlab CI yaml file. Specify any configurations that are needed. Kindly be as detailed as possible. Alternatively, you can also share a youtube video (unlisted url only) where you show the configuration and setup needed to deploy your solution.</p>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<br /><br /><h2>Final Submission Guidelines</h2>Submit the deployment guide or video url, along with the gitlab ci yaml file and any other files needed for deployment. We don&rsquo;t expect any changes to the source code so you don&rsquo;t have to submit the sample source code that you used, but if you do submit, that&rsquo;s fine too.","descriptionFormat":"HTML","projectId":8180,"created":"2018-12-15T07:34:17Z","createdBy":"callmekatootie","updated":"2019-01-04T11:21:56Z","updatedBy":"manish_yadav","timelineTemplateId":"140b24d5-5259-4449-bc1f-3780f3b01555","phases":[{"id":"cde3d1e5-948d-4d33-977f-f2a2cfc3e8b2","name":"Registration","phaseId":"a93544bc-c165-4af4-b55e-18f3593b457a","duration":864000,"scheduledStartDate":"2018-12-15T08:03:19Z","scheduledEndDate":"2019-01-04T11:17:15Z","actualStartDate":"2018-12-15T08:03:19Z","actualEndDate":"2019-01-04T11:17:15Z","isOpen":false},{"id":"ef258931-b812-4336-b956-d00a39af8316","name":"Iterative Review","phaseId":"003a4b14-de5d-43fc-9e35-835dbeb6af1f","duration":86400,"scheduledStartDate":"2018-12-15T19:52:49Z","scheduledEndDate":"2018-12-16T08:43:50Z","actualStartDate":"2018-12-15T19:52:49Z","actualEndDate":"2018-12-16T08:43:50Z","isOpen":false},{"id":"6a2314ba-f8d8-4f2b-9b7c-f9faa320089f","name":"Submission","phaseId":"6950164f-3c5e-4bdc-abc8-22aaf5a1bd49","duration":863640,"scheduledStartDate":"2018-12-15T08:13:29Z","scheduledEndDate":"2019-01-04T11:21:59Z","actualStartDate":"2018-12-15T08:13:29Z","actualEndDate":"2019-01-04T11:21:59Z","isOpen":false},{"id":"d7897fa0-41fc-4a7d-a53c-ff5df905acc0","name":"Iterative Review","phaseId":"003a4b14-de5d-43fc-9e35-835dbeb6af1f","duration":86400,"scheduledStartDate":"2018-12-16T08:47:43Z","scheduledEndDate":"2018-12-16T09:42:14Z","actualStartDate":"2018-12-16T08:47:43Z","actualEndDate":"2018-12-16T09:42:14Z","isOpen":false},{"id":"54abd3ce-5f48-4e4a-982d-85880c5a03e3","name":"Iterative Review","phaseId":"003a4b14-de5d-43fc-9e35-835dbeb6af1f","duration":86400,"scheduledStartDate":"2018-12-16T09:47:28Z","scheduledEndDate":"2018-12-16T11:15:21Z","actualStartDate":"2018-12-16T09:47:28Z","actualEndDate":"2018-12-16T11:15:21Z","isOpen":false}],"terms":[{"id":"9ef9dec4-dddb-48c9-9cce-659db68bc5ac","roleId":"732339e7-8e30-49d7-9198-cccf9451e221"},{"id":"e3370508-a541-4b9c-b83f-3bad33dcca4c","roleId":"3eedd4a4-3c68-4f68-8de4-a1ca5c2055e5"},{"id":"e3370508-a541-4b9c-b83f-3bad33dcca4c","roleId":"318b9c07-079a-42d9-a81f-b96be1dc1099"},{"id":"e3370508-a541-4b9c-b83f-3bad33dcca4c","roleId":"ff556573-5da6-4392-b38c-08c1d7599c4a"},{"id":"e3370508-a541-4b9c-b83f-3bad33dcca4c","roleId":"e0544b94-6420-4afc-8f63-238eddc751b9"},{"id":"aaa50b65-fb27-44e1-8398-03d70ce4ac5a","roleId":"0e9c6879-39e4-4eb6-b8df-92407890faf1"},{"id":"11ad4ba8-c3ec-4cf9-98e6-c7f43a5bd89f","roleId":"cfe12b3f-2a24-4639-9d8b-ec86726f76bd"},{"id":"e3370508-a541-4b9c-b83f-3bad33dcca4c","roleId":"d663fc84-5c37-43d1-a537-793feffb7667"}],"startDate":"2018-12-15T08:03:19Z","numOfSubmissions":3,"numOfRegistrants":23,"endDate":"2018-12-16T11:15:21Z","currentPhaseNames":[],"registrationStartDate":"2018-12-15T08:03:19Z","registrationEndDate":"2019-01-04T11:17:15Z","submissionStartDate":"2018-12-15T08:13:29Z","submissionEndDate":"2019-01-04T11:21:59Z","prizeSets":[{"type":"placement","description":"Challenge Prizes","prizes":[{"value":250,"type":"USD"}]}],"tags":["AWS","Gitlab","Node.js","NodeJS"],"groups":[],"winners":[{"handle":"Sharathkumar92","placement":"1"}],"metadata":[{"name":"allowStockArt","value":"false"}],"events":[{"id":3451,"name":"2019 Topcoder(R) Open","key":"tco19"}]},{"id":"71e92ff5-3b18-4fbd-96b7-ea0b8784e5f4","legacyId":"30077074","status":"Completed","track":"Development","type":"Challenge","trackId":"9b6fc876-f4d9-4ccb-9dfd-419247628825","typeId":"927abff4-7af9-4145-8ba1-577c16e64e2e","legacy":{"track":"DEVELOP","subTrack":"CODE","forumId":54490,"directProjectId":20057,"reviewType":"COMMUNITY","reviewScorecardId":30002053},"task":{"isTask":false,"isAssigned":false,"memberId":null},"name":"Bitbucket Unauthorized Content Check - Initial PoC","description":"<h2><strong>Challenge Objectives</strong></h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><strong>Target environment</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent\">: </span><em>Bitbucket Git Repo</em></span></span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent\"><strong>Basic Requirements:</strong> </span><span style=\"background-color:transparent\">Given a list of strings and repo names, generate a report using a script of any </span></span></span><span style=\"background-color:transparent;

Create a &quot;Nerve Center&quot; or command center room in their headquarters, that will monitor, react and predict all things related to IIOT connected devices (assets) within Vulcan factories and plants. <span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong>This is the goal for this challenge!</strong></span><br />\n<br />\nWe want to achieve the following experiences at the end of this RUX challenge:<br />\n- The Nerve Center Big Screen View Experience for all Users&nbsp;<br />\n- The Nerve Center experience and screens for the collaboration tool (this is a live view of the collaboration)<br />\n<br />\n<strong>RUX Challenge Timeline and Rolling Checkpoint</strong><br />\n- Submission Start: <strong>Thursday, 12/13/2018 at 08:00 AM EST</strong><br />\n- Rolling Checkpoint Start: <strong>Saturday, 12/15/2018 at 08:00 AM EST</strong><br />\n- Submission End: <strong>Sunday, 12/16/2018 at 08:00 AM EST</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>We are offering 5 Prizes Placements</strong><br />\n1) 1st Placement: $2000<br />\n2) 2nd Placement: $1500<br />\n3) 3rd Placement: $1000<br />\n4) 4th Placement: $750<br />\n5) 5th Placement: $500<br />\n- Plus 8 placements for Rolling Checkpoint prizes @ $50 each!<br />\n<br />\n<em><strong>Note: Important Rolling Checkpoint Details</strong><br />\n- High-Def and&nbsp;</em><em>adroc will answer questions and provide Rolling Feedback as fast as possible.<br />\n- You must watch the Forum for your feedback!<br />\n- All initial qualifying checkpoint submissions will win $50 (Only 8 potential submissions)</em><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Challenge Forum</strong></span><br />\nPlease ask in challenge forum for any doubts/questions regarding challenge requirements:<br />\n<a href=\"https://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=ThreadList&amp;forumID=650002\">https://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=ThreadList&amp;forumID=650002</a><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Nerve Center Short Description</strong></span><br />\n- The Nerve center (NC) will become the central intelligence unit for the Vulcan company asset management operation<br />\n- Our Vision for the NC is that it will be connecting and orchestrating the global operations for 100+ plants/factory and 1500+ machines&nbsp;<br />\n- In the beginning, NC will focus on the following:\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">- Enables hyper-speed collaboration among Vulcan Employees and Experts. For example, a Chinese CNC specialist will become available for supporting a solution to a rare CNC problem in Poland in less than 10 minutes. The collaboration will be enhanced by AR and real-time translation technologies</div>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">- Predict and prompt machine failures</div>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">- Captures tacit knowledge and digests it into structured knowledge for the company to learn at a global scale</div>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">- Compares and contrasts asset performance from multiple angles, identifies top performers, elicits what top performers do differently, absorbs and disseminates this knowledge</div>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">- Enables hyper-speed tactical decision making in times of emergency and operational disruptions</div>\n<br />\n<strong>Key Concept: </strong>People and Assets (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Internet_of_Things\">IIOT</a> machines) are the key elements of the Nerve Center. We do not want to &quot;drill down&quot; but we want to explode upward from the Asset to understand and tackle issues quickly.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>User Personas</strong></span><br />\n<strong>01) Nerve Center Room&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<strong>Maestro (In-Scope)</strong><br />\nOrchestrates the operational flow in the nerve center with some AI assistance. Works in sync with other Maestros. A Maestro can support 3 activities in parallel.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Nerve Center Facilitator (In-Scope)</strong><br />\nOn duty employee that see live things happening in the NC. they will funnel Maestro requests and enable work to get done, real-time reacting.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Diagnostics Expert (DE) (out of scope)</strong><br />\nWhen the maintenance team faces a machine failure and cannot understand its root cause, the DE is the first one to look at the failure. Minimum output expected from him/her is to let the nerve center know what kind of expertise is needed given the diagnosis. It is very likely to have DEs in the nerve center who can trigger SME associations.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>02) Factory Persona&#39;s (In Scope)<br />\nTechnicians: Onsite</strong><br />\nThe technicians work at the plant. They help the DE to understand the problem, follows diagnostics instructions, solves the problem together with the Expert (SME). The Technician sends an SOS if they need assistance (we assume the Technician follows the internal process and gets the required approvals internally in the plant).<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Subject Matter Expert (SME): Onsite or Remote</strong><br />\nHas deep vertical expertise on a matter like &#39;software problems in laser cutting machines&#39;. The expertise is defined at least 2 dimensional: asset classes + problem classes. She takes over the problem once the DE has a diagnosis.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>03) Nerve Center Support (Out of Scope)</strong><br />\n- Note we have support roles that help put knowledge into the Nerve Center App - Improving the Nerve Center base knowledge. Potential roles in the support would be:\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">- Data Scientist&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">- Data Science Developer</div>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">- Deployment Person (programmer)</div>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">- Training and Quality Expert</div>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">- Technical Exec&nbsp;</div>\n- We left off the descriptions - can provide them if you feel they will help you with your concepts.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Nerve Center: Screen and Feature Requests</strong></span><br />\nFor this challenge, we are looking for the below screens to be designed/considered in your concepts. Do not allow the suggestions below to impact the creativity of design. If there is a better way to accomplish the same goal, then feel free to take creative liberties.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>01) Nerve Center (Command Center) Screens layout and Interactions:</strong><br />\n- Nerve Center &ndash; gets Vulcan company to have insight and make decisions faster<br />\n- Picture a Huge Screen with several windows/inner screens/widgets and a conductor/maestro overseeing it, and choosing which windows to zoom into and analyze, etc&nbsp;<br />\n- The windows/inner screens/widgets (within the big screen) should be ordered to logically tell a story)<br />\n- Think of the immediate view and then views that would showcase SOS situation, Experts (collaboration situation), Factory View, Asset View<br />\n<br />\n<strong>02) Live Asset and Plant Overview Status:</strong><br />\n- The focus is on KPIs and showing data that can be used to make business decisions in the factories and Plants<br />\n- Show live and real-time information about all Vulcan operation assets (this could be like a default view)<br />\n- Show all Plants/Factory Summary information&nbsp;<br />\n- Shows number of critical, vulnerable and stable machines<br />\n- Resources Summary List (Available Experts, Technicians, and Other Personnel)<br />\n- List of Online Users that are using the Nerve Center<br />\n- NC Base Knowledge Status<br />\n<br />\n<strong>03) SOS Management features:</strong><br />\n- Receive SOS request that needs immediate attention from Technician or Plant Manager on site (how is this shown on the screen, what items move?)<br />\n- Checking whether the issue can be solved in the Nerve Center or not (manual? Or via AI?)<br />\n- Finding Available Experts (Think of Uber selection):\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">-- Assign Expert and connecting them directly to the person onsite in the Factory/Plants</div>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">-- Receive an Issue report from Expert and Technician or Plant Manager</div>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">-- Close Issue Case</div>\n<br />\n<strong>04) Work in Progress (WIP)</strong><br />\n- Shows the status of flows that have been set by maestros. Flows are made up of operations blocks. (These might be brought up to discuss issues - so possible full-screen usage.)<br />\n<br />\n- Plants View:\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">-- The user can dig down into the plants to see more detail information about it</div>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">-- Shows selected Plants building layout in various views (3D, Photos, plants building diagram)&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">-- Show information related to the Plants (Employee numbers, Productivity through years, All asset/machine available in the plant, etc)&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">-- Also, shows the flow of material for the current and backlog Work orders for the machine/asset.&nbsp;</div>\n<br />\n- Machine/Asset View:\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">-- Show all Machine IOT status&nbsp;<br />\n-- Shows various Machine images, for an example: Photos of Machine, a 3d isometric picture of the machine with a mathematical representation of the machine with 50+ sensor readings for 50+ machine components overlaid, Machine diagram, etc<br />\n-- Machine performance/operational KPI</div>\n<br />\n- Ops View:\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">-- Lists the current work order being produced and the backlog work orders of the machine. Work order refers to: {SKU, Qty, start date time, end date time, produced number, remaining number, next machine}</div>\n<br />\n- Schedule View:&nbsp;\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">-- Shows the Gantt chart for the plant. But for only the machines that are en route for the current and backlog work orders.</div>\n<br />\n- Expert Schedules view:\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">-- It helps maestro to see the feasible session time for the selected participants.<br />\n-- Upcoming Sessions, Shows the planned sessions</div>\n<br />\n- Inbox View:\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">-- Shows the current activity and backlog of the roles involved in the NC operations. Used by maestro assign activities.</div>\n<br />\n<strong>05) Additional Features</strong><br />\n- As a designer any additional thoughts or features you would like to showcase?<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong>06) Presentation Screen - 1920x1080 (16:9 Ratio)</strong><br />\n- In a RUX challenge, this screen is the way to showcase your concept so keep it simple and make it look good!<br />\n- If you were walking into a meeting and needed to sell your idea - use this screen to showcase your concept.</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Branding Guidelines</strong></span><br />\n- Currently open to what a great &quot;command center&quot; UI approach should be&nbsp;<br />\n- Think about large screens/command center style&nbsp;<br />\n- Avoid contrasts that are too hard and too light<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Previous RUX Design</strong></span><br />\n- We are providing the screen designs from the previous RUX<br />\n- DO NOT copy these exactly. Use them as inspiration for where we want to continue to evolve the UI.&nbsp;<br />\n- There are design issues with these screens but we really liked the initial concepts and the direction. Evolve this with your &quot;Command Center&quot; UI.&nbsp;<br />\n- Color is very important! Clarity of data is very important!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Documentation&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<strong>Download all documentation from the challenge forum!</strong><br />\n- Branding Guidelines<br />\n- Previous RUX winning design (Design Direction)<br />\n- Photos (explaining the concept of the Nerve Center)<br />\n- Plant and Machine Images References (Use these as images for the plant and machines in your design)<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Screen Sizes (Important!!)</strong></span><br />\n- Big Screen in Command Center Room<br />\n- Resolution: 4K Display (16:9 screen ratio) -&nbsp;3840x2160px or 1920x1080px is fine for this challenge<br />\n- Use grid systems for your layout<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Marvel Prototype</strong></span><br />\n- We need you to upload your screens to MarvelApp.com<br />\n- Please request for your MarvelApp prototype in the respective

DPeak Challenge","description":"The goal of the Connectivity Map (CMap) is to build a resource of gene expression profiles to aid biomedical research and therapeutic discovery. The core CMap technology is an assay called L1000, which measures gene expression changes in cells. L1000 achieves a significant increase in throughput and a significant decrease in cost as compared to other gene expression technologies due in large part to the practice of measuring two genes using the same physical material (in this case, microscopic beads). After data collection, the expression values of the two genes are computationally extracted in a process called &quot;peak deconvolution&quot;. The current implementation, an algorithm called D-Peak, is effective but imperfect, and hence the aim of this contest is to improve D-Peak, which we hypothesize will enable CMap to produce higher quality data more efficiently.<br />\n<br />\nIf you want to learn the science behind CMap and L1000, see the Background section in the very bottom of this page, and/or visit the CMap website at <a href=\"https://clue.io/\">clue.io</a>.<br />\n<br />\nThis match is rated and TCO-eligible. Threshold for TCO-eligibility: 10% improvement of the benchmark solution score on the final test dataset.<br />\n<br />\nRegistration / submission deadline: 09:00 AM ET on January 18, 2019\n<h3>The Problem</h3>\nFor the purpose of this challenge, the core CMap technology can be described as follows.<br />\n<br />\nIn a single experiment, CMap makes 488 measurements. Each measurement produces an intensity histogram (a list of integers), which characterizes expression of two distinct genes in the sample (for a total of 488 x 2 = 976 genes). In the ideal case, each histogram consists of two peaks (see Figure 1), each corresponding to a single gene. The genes are mixed in 2:1 ratio, thus the areas under the peaks have 2:1 ratio, which allows us to associate each peak with the specific gene. The median position of each peak corresponds to the gene&#39;s expression level, and that&#39;s what you need to determine in this challenge.<br />\n<br />\nFor training purposes, you are given two sets of about 384 experiments each (a total of 488 x 384 = 187,392&nbsp; measurements, with each histogram consisting of ~50 - 100 observations); and you are asked to develop code that takes each set as input, deconvolutes the data, and returns a matrix with the median position of each peak for the 976 genes (rows) in the approximately 384 experiments (columns).&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe resulting deconvoluted (DECONV) data will be compared against the corresponding data obtained by a more accurate, yet more expensive, measurement strategy, called &quot;UNI&quot;, in which each measurement is focused on a single gene (see the Scoring section below).<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:cambria; font-size:12pt\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/560LxnDXqbeYFCDt2OhLto8VHOCAfSIackvMa8ozpaXQltrJamOYI_2qYY8DwyJXDBkKO5ydt2fd-xjzI-XbLFbSmbXKitlER0FJFe8VIWsdc5fCkeOgyzWHlgCSvZt48Npw9pgM\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0.00rad); border:none; height:255px; transform:rotate(0.00rad); width:624px\" /></span>\n\n<p><strong>Figure 1. D-Peak algorithm schematics</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Current Benchmark Solution.</strong> CMap&#39;s current solution to this problem is based on a K-means clustering algorithm that works as follows. For each measurement, the K-means clustering algorithm partitions the list of realizations into K &gt;= 2 distinct clusters and identifies two of the clusters whose ratio of membership is as close as possible to 2:1. The algorithm, then, takes the median for each of the two clusters, assigning these values to the appropriate gene (i.e., matching clusters with more observations to the gene mixed in higher proportion).<br />\n<br />\nKnown problems with the current approach are that the K-means algorithm is generally a biased and inconsistent estimator of the peaks of a bimodal distribution and, it fails sometimes to detect peaks with few observations, or it incorrectly identifies these peaks as 3<sup>rd</sup> peaks, disregarding them. Another limitation is that the K-means clustering algorithm is computationally costly and, hence, expensive for data generation at scale (current Matlab implementation, with some additional post-processing, takes about 30 minutes on a 12-core server to process sets of 384 experiments).</p>\n\n<h3>Input Data</h3>\n\n<p>Each of training, provisional, and final datasets consits of two sets of experiments. A single set of experiments is represented by a folder containing ~384 tab-separated files, one per experiment. The folder is named after the set, e.g.&nbsp;<span style=\"font-family:courier new,courier,monospace\">DPK.CP001_A549_24H_X1_B42</span>, and each file in that folder is named appending a 3-symbol experiment label and file extension, like <span style=\"font-family:courier new,courier,monospace\">_B14.txt</span>, resulting in the names like&nbsp;<span style=\"font-family:courier new,courier,monospace\">DPK.CP001_A549_24H_X1_B42_B14.txt&nbsp;</span>(these names encode additional information that is irrelevant to you).<br />\n<br />\nEach of these files has two columns: one identifying the measurement (<em>barcode_id</em>) and one with the realizations (<em>FI</em>). Measurements have approximately the same number of realizations, although there is variability due to detection failure.<br />\n<br />\nAn additional file (<span style=\"font-family:courier new,courier,monospace\">barcode_to_gene_map.txt</span>) contains a mapping between each unique measurement (<em>barcode_id</em>) and the two genes (<em>gene_id</em>) it measures in DUO mode; it also includes a column (<em>high_prop</em>) that indicates which gene of the pair is mixed in higher (=1) or lower (=0) proportion.</p>\n\n<h3>Output Data</h3>\nFor each input dataset your code will generate a matrix of non-negative numbers, representing estimated median intensities, for 976 genes (rows) in approximately 384 experiments (columns).<br />\n<br />\nThe matrix will be written out into a GCT file, named the same way as the folder containing the test set, with <span style=\"font-family:courier new,courier,monospace\">.gct</span> file extension appended in the end. The GCT format is a tab-delimetered text file that describes an expression dataset (see <a href=\"https://clue.io/connectopedia/gct_format\">here</a>). Example GCT files will be provided in the competitor pack.\n\n<h3>Submission Format</h3>\nYou will submit a <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/\">dockerized</a> version of your algorithm. The scoring system will build a Docker container out of it, and will run it for each of test sets, passing in four arguments: <span style=\"font-family:courier new,courier,monospace\">--dspath PATH/TO/INPUT/DATASET/FOLDER</span>, <span style=\"font-family:courier new,courier,monospace\">--out /PATH/TO/OUTPUT/FOLDER</span>, <span style=\"font-family:courier new,courier,monospace\">--create_subdir 0</span>, and&nbsp;<span style=\"font-family:courier new,courier,monospace\">--plate TEST_SET_NAME</span>. The first argument points to the folder containing ~384 experiment files; the second argument point to the folder where you will write the output GCT file; the third argument to be ignored, it is there just for compatibility with the benchmark solution; and the last argument tells you how to name the output file.<br />\n<br />\nIn the challenge forum you will find competitor pack with local test &amp; score harness, and basic instructions for dockerization of your algorithms. In case of any Docker-related problems, do not hesitate to ask help in the forum.<br />\n<br />\nThe online scoring system and leaderboard will become available a few days after the match launch.\n<h3>Scoring</h3>\nYour submissions will be scored based on <em>accuracy</em> and <em>speed</em>.<br />\n<br />\nRegarding accuracy, we will compare your outcomes with the corresponding data obtained by a more accurate, yet more expensive, gene expression technology, called &lsquo;UNI&rsquo;, in which each bead type is used to measure a single gene.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe scoring function combines two measures of accuracy: one component of which is applied to deconvoluted (DECONV) data and one to differential expression (DE) data. DE is derived from DECONV by applying a series of transformations (parametric scaling, quantile normalization, and robust z-scoring) that are described in detail below and in <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5990023/\">Subramanian et al. 2017</a>. The local test &amp; score harness performs DECONV &gt; DE transformation as a part of the scoring, and keeps intermediate results, in case you need DE data.<br />\n<br />\nThe reason for scoring DE data is because it is at this level where the most interesting gene expression changes are observed. Of particular interest is obtaining significant improvement in the detection of, so called, &ldquo;extreme modulations.&rdquo; These are genes that, after a series of necessary transformations, exhibit an exceedingly high (or low) DE values relative to a fixed threshold. It is therefore desirable to assess accuracy here as well as DECONV.<br />\n<br />\nThe specific accuracy metrics are described below and outlined in Figure 2.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:cambria; font-size:12pt\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/IqTt4KC_thCmx27xGYcsXYRRzkLdcw3Vvx75HkheMt2myty3XbCB-CEgduqgCpY02s9gwQs2EsuByxoPyZys0QfV5Pf8U6C4Y1AHjjsL_pkyM3UQDDTOXYOexHFS4vWrGg5WzRY4\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0.00rad); border:none; height:612px; transform:rotate(0.00rad); width:624px\" /></span><br />\n<strong>Figure 2. Accuracy scoring schematic</strong>\n\n<h3>Accuracy Based on Spearman Correlation</h3>\nThe first component of the scoring function is based on the Spearman rank correlation between the provided DECONV data and the corresponding UNI data.<br />\n<br />\nFor a given dataset <em>p</em>, let <em>M<sub>DUO, p</sub></em> and <em>M<sub>UNI, p</sub></em> denote the matrices of the estimated gene intensities for <em>G&nbsp;</em>= 976 genes (rows) and <em>S&nbsp;</em>~ 384 experiments (columns) under DUO and UNI detection.&nbsp; Compute the Spearman rank correlation matrix between the rows of <em>M<sub>DUO, p</sub></em> and the rows of <em>M<sub>UNI, p</sub></em>; take the median of the diagonal elements of the resulting matrix (i.e., the values corresponding to the matched experiments between UNI and DUO) to compute the median correlation per dataset:<br />\n<br />\n<em>COR<sub>p</sub>&nbsp;= median(diag(spearman(M<sub>DUO, p</sub>, M<sub>UNI, p</sub>))</em>\n\n<h3>Accuracy Based on AUC</h3>\nThe second component of the scoring function is based on the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) that uses the competitor&#39;s DE values at various thresholds to predict the UNI&#39;s DE values being higher than 2 (&quot;high&quot;) or lower than -2 (&quot;low&quot;).<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nFor a given bead type <em>a</em> in a given dataset <em>p</em>, let <em>AUC<sub>p, c</sub></em><sup>&nbsp;</sup>denote the corresponding area under the curve where c = { <em>high</em> | <em>low&nbsp;</em>}, where&nbsp;<em>high&nbsp;</em>means&nbsp;<em>UNI<sub>DE, p&nbsp;</sub>&gt;=&nbsp;2</em>, and&nbsp;<em>low&nbsp;</em>means&nbsp;<em>UNI<sub>DE, p </sub>&lt;= &minus;2</em>; then, compute the arithmetic mean of the area under the curve per class to obtain the corresponding score per dataset:<br />\n<br />\n<em>AUC<sub>p</sub> = (AUC<sub>p, hight</sub> + AUC<sub>p, low</sub>) / 2</em>\n\n<h3>Speed Component of the Score</h3>\nFor a given dataset <em>p</em>, the time component of the score is computed as the run time in seconds for deconvoluting the data in both test cases: <em>Runtime<sub>p</sub></em><br />\n<br />\nNotice that multi-theading is allowed in this match, and thus highly recommended.

This new technology uses an assay called L1000 to measure gene expression of a select subset of approximately 1,000 genes, called landmarks. This procedure enables researchers to study the connections between genes, drugs, and diseases at a large scale (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5990023/\">Subramanian et al. 2017</a>).<br />\n<br />\nThe core CMap experiment is to treat cultured cells with various perturbations and measure the corresponding gene expression response using L1000. The L1000 assay is based on Luminex bead technology and uses multiple bead types to simultaneously measure the expression of many genes. When the beads are scanned, two values are obtained from each bead: one indicating the color of the bead (the target analyte) and the other indicating the intensity of the signal, which is a reflection of mRNA expression (Appendix Figure 1 below). The beads are read on a dual-laser flow-based scanner. One laser classifies the bead and determines the bead type that is being detected. The second laser determines the magnitude of the PE-derived signal, which is in direct proportion to the amount of bound analyte.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:cambria; font-size:12pt\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/yZcyA6oOtnDa5D21z_dAfRxNHZx2pankRLsSyfmUt7RTIGuvSirCHwm7x1gJG5V1u45O9SlSaAEs5AaIMtvFJggMj5lxVAqghocRSYFAp-wTSP13xl8_AkNVLwqAJ2GulddgQC_B\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0.00rad); border:none; height:479px; transform:rotate(0.00rad); width:624px\" /></span><br />\n<strong>Appendix Figure 1.</strong> Luminex detection schematic. Reproduced from <a href=\"https://www.rndsystems.com/resources/technical/luminex-bead-based-assay-principle\">https://www.rndsystems.com/resources/technical/luminex-bead-based-assay-principle</a>. In the CMap application, oligonucleotides are used instead of antibodies, but the overall principle remains the same.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough the scanner is designed to detect only 500 different bead types, CMap uses it to measure ~1000 landmark genes (978 genes to be exact). Of the 500 available types, 12 are used to measure controls. The remaining 488 colors are each used to measure two genes. The 976 landmark genes (excluding two genes that are measured independently) are grouped into pairs and coupled to beads of the same color. Genes coupled to the same bead color are combined in a ratio of 2:1 prior to use. So, the detected signal intensity for each bead color provides a composite measure of the abundance of the transcripts of the two genes.<br />\n<br />\nThe main problem is to split this composite measure into two individual intensity values, one for each of the genes coupled with the same bead color.<br />\nTo deconvolute the composite expression signal into two values and associate them with the appropriate genes, CMap employs an algorithm called &quot;dpeak&quot;. The basic elements of the algorithm are as follows, but more details can be found at <a href=\"https://clue.io/connectopedia/measuring_expr_of_1000_genes\">https://clue.io/connectopedia/measuring_expr_of_1000_genes</a>.\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>It constructs a histogram of fluorescence intensity values for all beads of a specific color. This yields a distribution that generally consists of two peaks (as in the Figure below): a larger one that designates expression of the gene for which a larger proportion of beads are present, and a smaller peak representing the other gene.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Using a k-means clustering algorithm, the distribution is partitioned into two distinct clusters, such that the ratio of cluster membership is as close as possible to 2:1, and the median expression value for each cluster is then assigned as the expression value of the appropriate gene.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>In cases where two peaks are not resolvable, the median expression of the distribution is assigned to both genes.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\nThe current implementation also carries out plate-level adjustments after running dpeak on all samples from the same plate.<br />\n<br />\nKnown issues / challenges to overcome:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Sometimes the algorithm fails to detect peaks with low memberships or incorrectly identify them as 3rd peaks</li>\n\t<li>The k-means clustering is generally biased and inconsistent estimator of the gene distributions (<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287829457_On_the_bias_and_inconsistency_of_K-means_clustering\">Jin 2016</a>)</li>\n\t<li>Errors are more frequent when few (less than ~30) beads are observed</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:cambria; font-size:12pt\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wtQ7pv4eLKwV3-AvHrkxmak3psQPbsHzCMEssbPxQYelMfqoPkNaLOGvTWjUGJmfbxq_DR_6Bau0MtfMNQhxk3VfAhAQ54R0erAP1s-XmFxRGIztRpPl7M-Wj89nGWngWWzY0xq\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0.00rad); border:none; height:229px; transform:rotate(0.00rad); width:624px\" /></span><br />\n<strong>Appendix Figure 2.</strong> D-Peak error modes.\n\n<h3>Additional adjustments made by CMap k-means implementation</h3>\nThe current implementation also applies a heuristic, called flip-adjust, which aims to identify and correct instances where the two peaks may have been misassigned. After dpeak has run, flip-adjust collects all data across all wells in the given plate for a given analyte. It then performs a two-class linear discriminant analysis (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis#LDA_for_two_classes\">LDA</a>) on the plate-wide data using both the bead count and deconvoluted expression values as features (Appendix Figure 3 below). It then uses the discriminator to try and classify the count/expression data from every sample in every well. If the two genes from the same well are simultaneously misclassified, according to the dpeak-assigned labels, then these labels are reversed. This is based on the assumption that it is highly improbable that both genes on the same analyte in the same well will have count and expression values that deviate widely from the plate-wide population. Empirically we observe that flip-adjust only impacts a very small percentage of all data, but competitors may find useful the concept of leveraging data across multiple wells.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:cambria; font-size:12pt\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/7pIcYwXi2fu9bhMeqpRrKSScTa9E2en49aHz0vu80Gq4mMJQlnkA_BAy0CG5dBRwE5ymIZEOBYakl5Ovzih6-wY3KXmeOTd4YR8GF0bpSSeJbZjgQnlAL-FuLGmthXIM5pgYpCpC\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0.00rad); border:none; height:440px; transform:rotate(0.00rad); width:624px\" /></span><br />\n<strong>Appendix Figure 3.</strong> Example of a flip adjustment.

Each column represents a specific experiment (e.g. treatment with a small-molecule drug) and each row represents genes that are measured in the L1000 assay. In this contest, GCT matrix dimensions are encoded into the filename. For example, the file DPK.CP001_A549_24H_X1_B42_n376x976.gct contains 376 columns and 976 rows. For more information on the GCT format, please see <a href=\"https://clue.io/connectopedia/gct_format\">https://clue.io/connectopedia/gct_format</a>.\n\n<h3>Data Transformation</h3>\nData are transformed from DECONV to DE using the steps outlined below, and in <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5990023/\">Subramanian et al. 2017</a>.\n\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong>Invariant set normalization</strong><br />\n\t<br />\n\tWe use a rescaling procedure called L1000 Invariant Set Scaling, or LISS, involving 80 control transcripts (8 each at 10 levels of low to high expression) that we empirically found to be invariant in historic, non-L1000 data. The 80 genes are used to construct a calibration curve for each sample. Each curve is computed using the median expression of the 8 invariant genes at each of the 10 pre-defined invariant levels. We then loess-smooth the data and fit the following power law function using non-linear least squares regression:<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<em>y=ax<sup>b</sup>+c</em><br />\n\t<br />\n\twhere <em>x</em> is the unscaled data and <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em> are constants estimated empirically. The entire sample is then rescaled using the obtained model.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile_normalization\">Quantile normalization</a></strong><br />\n\t<br />\n\tWe then standardize the shape of the expression profile distributions on each plate by applying quantile normalization, or QNORM. This is done by first sorting each profile by expression level, and then normalizing the data by setting the highest-ranking value in each profile to the median of all the highest ranking values, the next highest value to the median of the next highest values, and so on down to the data for the lowest expression level.&nbsp;<br />\n\t&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><strong>Robust Z-scoring</strong><br />\n\t<br />\n\tTo obtain a measure of relative gene expression, we use a robust <em>z</em>-scoring procedure to generate differential expression values from normalized profiles. We compute the differential expression of gene <em>x</em> in the ith sample on the plate as:<br />\n\t<br />\n\t<em>( x<sub>i</sub> - median(X) ) / ( 1.4826&nbsp; MAD(X) )</em><br />\n\t<br />\n\twhere <em>X</em> is the vector of normalized gene expression of gene <em>x</em> across all samples on the plate, MAD is the median absolute deviation of <em>X</em>, and the factor of 1.4826 is a scaling constant to rescale the data as if the standard deviation were used instead of the median absolute deviation.</li>\n</ol>\n","descriptionFormat":"HTML","projectId":8180,"created":"2018-12-12T20:51:06Z","createdBy":"birdofpreyru","updated":"2019-10-01T09:18:03Z","updatedBy":"jaya.dhaka","timelineTemplateId":"87ab69d5-09ec-45ef-b3d1-f6f6f1fdf2f3","phases":[{"duration":3016460,"scheduledEndDate":"2019-01-18T13:59:19Z","actualEndDate":"2019-01-18T13:59:19Z","isOpen":false,"name":"Registration","phaseId":"a93544bc-c165-4af4-b55e-18f3593b457a","actualStartDate":"2018-12-14T16:03:01Z","id":"245d1c43-e838-4809-ad8d-664fd686cd3d","scheduledStartDate":"2018-12-14T16:03:01Z"},{"duration":3016367,"scheduledEndDate":"2019-01-18T14:01:26Z","actualEndDate":"2019-01-18T14:01:26Z","isOpen":false,"name":"Submission","phaseId":"6950164f-3c5e-4bdc-abc8-22aaf5a1bd49","actualStartDate":"2018-12-14T16:08:12Z","id":"55912b04-9fa2-4a34-9209-36c842000ea8","scheduledStartDate":"2018-12-14T16:08:12Z"},{"duration":172800,"scheduledEndDate":"2019-01-31T04:25:39Z","actualEndDate":"2019-01-31T04:25:39Z","isOpen":false,"name":"Review","phaseId":"aa5a3f78-79e0-4bf7-93ff-b11e8f5b398b","actualStartDate":"2019-01-18T14:03:51Z","id":"2cfeab22-d0b0-46c5-bd76-9f32cdfe22a6","scheduledStartDate":"2019-01-18T14:03:51Z"}],"terms":[{"roleId":"d663fc84-5c37-43d1-a537-793feffb7667","id":"e3370508-a541-4b9c-b83f-3bad33dcca4c"},{"roleId":"732339e7-8e30-49d7-9198-cccf9451e221","id":"9ef9dec4-dddb-48c9-9cce-659db68bc5ac"},{"roleId":"3eedd4a4-3c68-4f68-8de4-a1ca5c2055e5","id":"e3370508-a541-4b9c-b83f-3bad33dcca4c"},{"roleId":"318b9c07-079a-42d9-a81f-b96be1dc1099","id":"e3370508-a541-4b9c-b83f-3bad33dcca4c"},{"roleId":"ff556573-5da6-4392-b38c-08c1d7599c4a","id":"e3370508-a541-4b9c-b83f-3bad33dcca4c"},{"roleId":"e0544b94-6420-4afc-8f63-238eddc751b9","id":"e3370508-a541-4b9c-b83f-3bad33dcca4c"},{"roleId":"0e9c6879-39e4-4eb6-b8df-92407890faf1","id":"aaa50b65-fb27-44e1-8398-03d70ce4ac5a"},{"roleId":"cfe12b3f-2a24-4639-9d8b-ec86726f76bd","id":"11ad4ba8-c3ec-4cf9-98e6-c7f43a5bd89f"}],"startDate":"2018-12-14T16:03:01Z","numOfSubmissions":857,"numOfRegistrants":294,"endDate":"2019-01-31T04:25:39Z","currentPhaseNames":[],"registrationStartDate":"2018-12-14T16:03:01Z","registrationEndDate":"2019-01-18T13:59:19Z","submissionStartDate":"2018-12-14T16:08:12Z","submissionEndDate":"2019-01-18T14:01:26Z","prizeSets":[{"prizes":[{"type":"USD","value":8000},{"type":"USD","value":6000},{"type":"USD","value":4000},{"type":"USD","value":2000},{"type":"USD","value":1000},{"type":"USD","value":800},{"type":"USD","value":600},{"type":"USD","value":400},{"type":"USD","value":200}],"description":"Challenge Prizes","type":"placement"}],"tags":["Marathon Match"],"groups":[],"winners":[],"metadata":[{"name":"allowStockArt","value":"false"}],"events":[{"name":"2019 Topcoder(R) Open","id":3451,"key":"tco19"}]},{"id":"c80a8fa2-145a-411b-a5a5-3d01e316252a","legacyId":"30076899","status":"Completed","track":"Data Science","type":"Challenge","trackId":"c0f5d461-8219-4c14-878a-c3a3f356466d","typeId":"927abff4-7af9-4145-8ba1-577c16e64e2e","legacy":{"track":"DEVELOP","subTrack":"CODE","forumId":54341,"directProjectId":18660,"reviewType":"INTERNAL","reviewScorecardId":30002053},"task":{"isTask":false,"isAssigned":false,"memberId":null},"name":"OLS Clickstream Retirement Predictor Ideation Challenge","description":"<p>Our customer wants to increase the retirement account sales to users who are already visiting their banking site. &nbsp;Your job is to analyze website visitor and account data and show how to identify likely buyers.</p>\n<span style=\"background-color:transparent;

color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">As a global wealth management bank, we are looking to analyze actions their clients perform in their web application. The main goal is to predict if the user is giving out signals that they are planning their retirement, ie opening a retirement account. The PoC is not to show predictions per se, its to show how to classify users, though of course for those visitors or visitor categories that may be potential buyers, it should output probabilities by class.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">In this challenge, you will get access to the submission which has data exploration and some basic analysis on how clickstream data can be used to qualify potential buyers of retirement accounts.</span></p>\n\n<h2><strong>Task Detail</strong></h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">In this challenge, the goal is to efficiently analyze the data, engineer the necessary features, and build an algorithm for predicting if the client is planning her retirement. The groundtruth is defined as whether the user will open a retirement account.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">In practice, at a certain time (e.g., every morning in weekdays), we will run the predictor algorithm, taking the input of all the client clickstream data and client information data until that time, and predict the probabilities of opening a retirement account within the next 7 days for all potential clients (i.e., who doesn&rsquo;t have a retirement account yet). </span></p>\n<span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The main idea is to use the clickstream data (primary data source) together with user information, such as demographic info (e.g., age), account info, and balances, to predict if the client is planning her retirement.

Therefore, </span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Please explore the effect of the size of training data -- how much of data should be given as input to the predictor without loss of too much accuracy?</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">If some of the data preparation can be precomputed, please describe how to build the exact pipeline for aggregating the data and show the efficiency improvement. For example one of your features might be &ldquo;total assets at age 25&rdquo; that can be calculated once and the predictor may not need all the earlier data.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">It is up to you to analyze the data and figure out the appropriate features for prediction -- be creative!

It wants to develop a Blockchain based Service for Identity creation, validation, attestation, and notarization. It will use KYC, EMR, and PII for identity-based processing.<br />\n<br />\nIn a service economy, identity information is the key connector between the service provider and the customer. For example, a customer who wants to open a new home mortgage account with a bank has to first submit Know Your Customer (KYC) details to the bank. The same customer will then need to provide KYC details to various utility providers for his new home. KYC details may vary based on the service provided, but all of them require a core set of details about the customer. In an ideal world, a centralized store of identity information may make the customer&rsquo;s life easier, but in the real world, centralized control of identity information is not entirely desirable.<br />\n<br />\nIt is a Blockchain based Digital Identity management system having the following scope:<br />\n- <a href=\"http://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html\">Identifiers, Names, and Discovery</a>&nbsp;<br />\n- <a href=\"http://identity.foundation/working-groups/storage-compute.html\">Storage and Compute</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n- <a href=\"http://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html\">Claims and Credentials</a>&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nMany organizations (companies and foundations)&nbsp; operate in the business of providing control of identity information to the customer/service seeker in a decentralized manner,&nbsp; but these do not interoperate with one another.<br />\n<br />\nHere are some references to such organizations, both the identity provider space and in the setting of standards for such identity. Reading this before proceeding would provide the bigger context. This is not a comprehensive list, you are free to research more of them.<br />\n<strong>1. Identity Foundation</strong><br />\n-<a href=\"http://http://identity.foundation/\"> http://identity.foundation/</a><br />\n- <a href=\"https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/a-universal-resolver-for-self-sovereign-identifiers-48e6b4a5cc3c\">https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/a-universal-resolver-for-self-sovereign-identifiers-48e6b4a5cc3c</a><br />\n<br />\n<strong>2.

(For example - this could be a claim to property ownership)<br />\n- Storage facilities for credentials and claims (wallet)<br />\n- Methods to validate/authenticate (Zero-knowledge proofs provided by BlockChain technology) these identities for the service provider<br />\n- Methods to attest the identity and claims of a user</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Challenge Forum</strong></span><br />\nIf you have any doubts or questions regarding challenge requirements, please ask in our challenge forum:<br />\n<a href=\"https://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=ThreadList&amp;forumID=649620���\">https://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=ThreadList&amp;forumID=649620 </a><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Screen Requirements</strong></span><br />\nFor this challenge, we are looking for the below pages to be designed/considered in your concepts. The screen functionality details listed below are suggested functionality for consideration. Do not allow the suggestions below to impact the creativity of design. If there is a better way to accomplish the same goal, then feel free to take creative liberties.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>General Screens<br />\n01) Landing Screen (Web/Desktop&nbsp;Screen)</strong><br />\n- Potential User will arrive on this page and will be able to find information about BeSecure application and use the app<br />\n- Needs to marketing the BeSecure app purpose and it&#39;s capability to attract potential user to use it&#39;s service<br />\n- Open to any suggestion for the landing page content (might need to give focus on BeSecure main features)<br />\n- Some landing page references from the similar products:\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">-- <a href=\"https://www.uport.me/\">https://www.uport.me/</a><br />\n-- <a href=\"https://shocard.com/\">https://shocard.com/</a><br />\n-- <a href=\"https://www.civic.com\">https://www.civic.com</a><br />\n-- Etc</div>\n<br />\n<strong>02) Login Screen (Both Web/Desktop and Android&nbsp;Screens)</strong><br />\n- All user needs to log in first before able to use the BeSecure application<br />\n- Need 2 login screen variations:\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">-- Android Login Screen for End User<br />\n-- Web/Desktop Login Screen for Enterprise User and Network Operator</div>\n- Default login form (Username, Password, Submit button, forgot password, remember me)<br />\n- Biometric login features (Scanning Face, Fingerprint)? Would nice to have this<br />\n- Error login scenario (wrong credential, etc)?<br />\n- Needs to have registration form features for Enterprise User and End User<br />\n<br />\n<strong>End User (Android App)</strong><br />\n<strong>03) Digital Identity Creation Screen (Android Screen)</strong><br />\n- After registering in the web/desktop, the user can download the BeSecure mobile application and login from there<br />\n- For first time user, they will need to create their digital identity in the app before able to use other features in the app<br />\n- End User will need to create their Digital Identity based (based on ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric) on the configuration using either as a DID (Decentralized Identity, which basically is user&#39;s id/account on any Blockchain network) or SSID (Self Sovereign Identity, created using available blockchain framework like sovrin or uPort)<br />\n- User will need to gather their personal information, such as:&nbsp;\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">-- Basic Information (First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, Social Security Number, Address, Phone Number, Email Address, Password)<br />\n-- Picture of Valid ID (Social Security Card, Driver License, Selfie using Camera, Passport, Birth Certificate, ID card, etc) - more IDs information, more valid data<br />\n-- BeSecure will extract information from these IDs and create either DID or SSID for the user<br />\n-- Once it&#39;s extracted, the user will be asked to confirm the data for one more time and then do self certifies<br />\n-- All IDs information will be stored and encrypted into a user device<br />\n-- Once the data IDs being confirmed by the user, the next step will be building security action to ensure the only user can use the data (Biometric features, fingerprint or face)<br />\n-- Everytime user wants to give authorization to their personal data, it will need to pass this security action first</div>\n<br />\n<strong>04) Dashboard Screen&nbsp;(Android Screen)</strong><br />\n- The android application will act as a digital wallet for the user<br />\n- Some reference about wallet in the market can be found from this link: <a href=\"https://edge.app/\">https://edge.app/&nbsp;&nbsp;</a><br />\n- Your wallet/dashboard design needs to be custom, it needs to have similar look and feel with the BeSecure app&nbsp;<br />\n- The wallet purpose is to manage all digital identities, claims, and asset related to the blockchain that belong to the user<br />\n- To access the wallet, the user will need to verify themselves (based on the security action earlier)<br />\n- The user will easily manage their IDs information from here (add new IDs, see existing IDs, Edit IDs, Delete IDs, etc)<br />\n- Multiple identities support - Potentially one can create multiple SSIDs for different purposes and to protect privacy - BeSecure will supports this, and it need a way to manage user multiple identities (driver license, passport, etc).<br />\n- The user can use the wallet when trying to apply for products and services and no longer need to upload the documents again<br />\n- All data and documents remain stored locally in user devices. No one has access to user information except the user themselves and it can never be shared without user consent.<br />\n- The wallet will also able to manage claims (add more information)<br />\n- The wallet also will be able to manage all cryptocurrency that the user has (Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc) - it needs to be able to simulate how much crypto asset that user currently have, request/received funds, etc (similar to the crypto wallet out there)<br />\n<br />\n- Trusted Agent List Features Sub-Screen:\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">-- Need to have a screen where the user can see the list of Trusted Agents provided by BeSecure<br />\n-- If the user needs Notarization of documents, they will use Trusted Agents service for this<br />\n-- Given how many groups of people are trying to tackle the identity problem, the Decentralized Identity Foundation, which counts more than 50 partner organizations, is coordinating various attempts at decentralized identity with the goal of making these systems interoperable so users aren&#39;t left with their personal data fragmented across multiple protocols. The user will have the Ability to see how many Trusted Agent available<br />\n-- In this screen, the user will be able to ask/request transaction to a 3rd party or doing ID verification trust from the available Trusted Agent<br />\n-- Need to have the ability to ask for &#39;Request Trust&#39; to a Trusted agent, which will bring the user to fill the Trust form before it sent to Trusted Agent</div>\n<br />\n- Transaction Features Sub-Screen:\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">-- In order to be able to easily use the Digital Identity or share IDs information to the 3rd party, the user will need to initiate and Identity verification of their ID by validate their data information IDs to a verifier or trusted agent<br />\n-- This screen purpose is to give the user a way to explore Proofs and Credentials to identify their ID<br />\n-- One of the Validation methods that available is by utilizing DID using ZKPs (Zero-Knowledge Proofs), With Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP), we have a prover, who is the individual, and a verifier, who needs to verify an individual&#39;s identity. In this case, all the prover needs to show a verifier is the value of X, without showing the actual information.

generated in this F2F.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Technology Stack</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The new groups API will be implemented in Node.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Code access</strong></p>\nThe existing code for the Groups API and the existing Swagger document that covers the existing groups endpoint will be available in the forum.\n\n<p><strong>Individual requirements</strong></p>\nFor this challenge, we want you to submit a new Swagger file that covers the new groups API.&nbsp; The functionality in the new API should match the functionality in the existing API provided in the forum, but your Swagger file must match the API standards PDF provided in the forum.&nbsp; If you see anywhere in the existing API that can be simplified, we&#39;re looking to try to make the new version function very simply, to avoid headaches like what we have now with the existing code.<br /><br /><h2>Final Submission Guidelines</h2>Please see

In this challenge, we are looking to <strong>conceptualize</strong> the first vision for a mobile application that will integrate all available ground transportation options and allow users to locate, compare, and purchase the most efficient and desirable path to their destination. In addition, the app will include public transit options and set the ground work for a universal public transportation card.<br />\n<br />\nWe are looking for an intuitive and easy to use &quot;wireframe concepts&quot; that will let us design and build the final mobile user interfaces on the next stage of this project. Think about what are the best UI/UX practices when creating this wireframe.<br />\n\n<h3 class='roundLabel'>Round 1</h3>The following are the minimum required screens for Round 1<br />\n2. Social Login<br />\n4. Introductions<br />\n5. Search<br />\n6. Location Based Services<br />\n8. Dashboard<br />\n11. Marketplace<br />\n12. Ratings &amp; Reviews<br />\n14. Product Listing<br />\n15. Activity Feed<br />\n16. Admin Tool<br />\n18. Reporting<br />\n\n<h3 class='roundLabel'>Round 2</h3>All required screens and features with the implementation of the provided checkpoint feedback.<br />The objective of this project is to create an application that will integrate all ground transportation services and build the most efficient and seamless way to travel under 50 miles.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nExample of ground transportation services is Uber, Lyft, Grab, VIA, Lime, charter buses like Greyhound and Mega Bus, and other local transit options.<br />\n<br />\nThis will lead to the creation of a universal public transportation card that can be used across the US and then the world. Long term goal would be the &ldquo;go to&rdquo; service for ground transportation.\n<h3><strong>User Roles</strong></h3>\nWe will add user accounts to the app:&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>1. Standard User (members)</strong><br />\nThis will be the riding public or the users that will access the app for transportation services.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>2. Admin User</strong><br />\nThese users can make/propose changes to the layout, color scheme, and aesthetics of the app but approval will be required from Super Admin to push these updates out to the brander user base of the application.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>3. Super Admin User</strong><br />\nA user that has full ability to edit app design and coding and the user can approve changes suggested by Admin user.\n<h3><strong>General Requirements</strong></h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Produce HTML click-through wireframes that can be used to demonstrate all mentioned functionalities as required in each round.</li>\n\t<li>The app must be very easy to use and intuitive. Keep that in mind when designing your solution.</li>\n\t<li>You MUST cover all use cases mentioned in screens requirements below and user roles above.</li>\n\t<li>You MUST use wireframes note pane in every single page you design to explain what cases/items are addressed in that page and what things you added/changed/removed.&nbsp; Use the note pane to make your idea clear and help the client give you constructive feedback.</li>\n\t<li>You are open to suggest ideas/concept that you think will best fit the app.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><strong>Screens Requirements and Features</strong></h3>\n<strong>1. Enterprise Login</strong><br />\n- This will integrate to an existing login mechanism, the required screen will allow the admins to login.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>2. Social Login</strong><br />\n- Allow users to register and login using third-party services such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google.&nbsp;<br />\n- We wanted to allow the user to login using their Uber or Lyft account. However, we are open to ideas/ suggestions of other ways for the user to login<br />\n- Support for Face ID/Touch ID for login<br />\n<br />\n<strong>3. Invitations</strong><br />\n- Allow users to invite others to use your app via email<br />\n<br />\n<strong>4. Introductions</strong><br />\n- Present the app and inform users of core functionality using a series of introductory screens.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>5. Search</strong><br />\n- The User needs the ability to search for a specific/desired ride services in case they aren&rsquo;t initially presented but should be available in their area.<br />\n- The user can quickly send us a note of a missing or desired ride service if it doesn&rsquo;t show up in their search.<br />\n- Autocomplete should be included&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>6. Location Based Services</strong><br />\n- The app must identify the user&#39;s location and the location of all nearby transportation services.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>7. Notifications</strong><br />\n- Remind users to do certain tasks or update them on any new related services or info.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>8. Dashboard</strong><br />\n- The app&rsquo;s central or main screen where users can access functionality<br />\n<br />\n<strong>9. Account Settings</strong><br />\n- Allow your users to adjust settings or specify preferences, such as communication frequency.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>10. Help/FAQs</strong><br />\n- Include a section dedicated to FAQ or Help content.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>11. Marketplace</strong><br />\n- This function will be necessary for the production of the universal transportation card. Users need the ability to purchase bus passes, train tickets, etc and use the MYTE app as their scannable proof of purchase<br />\n- The user will also need the functionality to request and pay for rides and from ride share (car, bike, and scooter) and taxi companies. This information will be plugged into and pulled from their existing account.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>12. Ratings &amp; Reviews</strong><br />\n- Another cool feature we wanted to add was giving users status based on how frequently they use the application. For example: Using the application to take any of the available services displayed:<br />\n<br />\n1 to 5 times/mth = Explorer<br />\n6 to 10 times/mth =&nbsp; Strategic Traveler&nbsp;<br />\n11 to 15 times/mth = Ground Commander&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n16+ times/mth = Almighty Status<br />\n<br />\n<strong>13. Payments</strong><br />\n- Allow users to pay in some way; for example, using credit cards, debit cards, PayPal, or Bitcoin.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>14. Product Listing</strong><br />\n- This feature is to shows lists of services, with individual detail pages for each one describing/showcasing that service.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>15. Activity Feed</strong><br />\n- Show your users an activity feed of some kind, as they&rsquo;re used to seeing on Facebook and Twitter, for example.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>16. Admin Tool</strong><br />\n- Administrative tool or panel to enable direct management of users, content and the application.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>17. Social Media Integration</strong><br />\n- The app must integrate with social media providers (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google+, etc).<br />\n<br />\n<strong>18. Reporting</strong><br />\n- The app must have the ability to report/export data on each user role.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>19. Contact Us</strong><br />\n- The app must have the ability to allow users to contact an administrator/send feedback to administrators.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>20. 3D Touch</strong><br />\n- Make use of 3D Touch on supported devices.<br />\n- This will add an additional dimension where users can access additional functionality by applying varying levels of pressure to the touchscreen. It should display a menu or showing additional content.\n<h3><strong>Screen Specifications</strong></h3>\nMobile: 750px width by 1334px height as screen size resolution.\n\n<h3><strong>Target User</strong></h3>\nTarget users will be the riding public that will greatly benefit to locate, compare, and purchase the most efficient and desirable path to their destination.\n\n<h3><strong>Judging Criteria</strong></h3>\n- User experience.<br />\n- Completeness and accuracy of the areas of functionality and content.<br />\n- How well your wireframes provide a consistent user flow and clear information architecture for the application.\n<h3><strong>Submission &amp; Source Files</strong></h3>\n<strong>Preview Image</strong><br />\nPlease create your preview image as one (1) 1024x1024px JPG or PNG file in RGB color mode at 72dpi and place a screenshot of your submission within it.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Submission File</strong><br />\nAll requested contest requirements/screens as clickable HTML files.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Source Files</strong><br />\nWireframes should be built in Axure. The resulting files should have generated HTML files. Also, all the content must be listed and the pages are linked together to show page flow.\n<h3><strong>Final Fixes</strong></h3>\nAs part of the Final Fix phase, you may be asked to remove, update, or change some features of the wireframe.<br

For example, application1 could have 1 component within it, application2 can have 5 components within it and so on. So, the overall status of the application is indicated by color codes (red, yellow and green).<br />\n- Ability to display real-time notifications to authorized users.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>02 Iteration Manager</strong><br />\n- This page allows the user to manage the iterations.<br />\n- It will allow choosing an existing iteration for configuring.<br />\n- Also, will allow the user to create a new iteration.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>02 1 Plan - Create Test Iteration:</strong><br />\n- This page allows users to create Test iteration &amp; relevant dates.<br />\n- Only authorized users to be able to create iteration by providing &ldquo;Iteration name, Business date, Testing dates &amp; planning dates&rdquo;.<br />\n- Once iteration is created, the user should be able to search for it and start configuring the same.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>03 Plan - Configuration Stops:</strong><br />\n- These are the stops that will be executed once iteration has been finalized.<br />\n- Ability to upload iteration plan in &ldquo;Excel&rdquo; format<br />\n- The user should be able to add new &ldquo;stops&rdquo; or modify/delete existing ones<br />\n- Each of the stops will have/include below details:<br />\n- - Type (Manual/Auto),<br />\n- - Business Date, Scheduled Date<br />\n- - Name, Description, Owner, Dependency<br />\n- Provide the flexibility for the user to copy, move or delete existing &ldquo;stops&rdquo;<br />\n<br />\n- Type = Manual vs Auto<br />\n- - - In Manual Mode, application execution flow is expected to stop during the manual stop. This should occur after all preceding steps are completed.<br />\n- - - In Auto mode, the system automatically executes a script when an event happens<br />\n- After saving the stops, the user should be able to retrieve the form again in its current state until its finalized (finalization of stops happens in 06 Plan - Finalize Functionality- please see below).<br />\n<br />\n<em>Dependency&nbsp;</em><br />\n- Stops can only be configured against a chosen Test Iterations<br />\n<br />\n<strong>04 Plan - Configure Ctrl M based Apps:</strong><br />\n- The purpose of this page is to configure applications &amp; relevant details associated with the given Test iteration.<br />\n- Only Authorized user should be able to choose&nbsp;Application name, control-m folders &amp; execution schedule - start/end time<br />\n- After saving the details, the user should be able to retrieve the form again in its current state until its finalized<br />\n<br />\n<em>Dependency</em><br />\n- This can only be configured against a chosen Test Iteration<br />\n- Application name and Control-M folders should be available as a part of drop down<br />\n<br />\n<strong>05 Plan - Feed Configuration:</strong><br />\n- The purpose of this page is to configure feeds required for given Test Iteration<br />\n- On load, The form to be pre-populated with last saved configurations<br />\n- Authorized user should be able to modify<br />\n- - Priority ( i.e. sequence in which feeds will be processed )<br />\n- - Respective application &amp; Feed names<br />\n- - Indicators flags for &ldquo;cyclic feeds&rdquo;, &ldquo;Source (prod vs Test)&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ignore/Applicable&rdquo;<br />\n- - Source and Destination paths<br />\n- After saving the details, the user should be able to retrieve the form again in its current state until its finalized<br />\n- The form should have added features like &ldquo;clear rows&rdquo;, &ldquo;Save all&rdquo; etc<br />\n<br />\n<em>Dependency</em><br />\n- This can only be configured against a chosen Test Iteration<br />\n- Application name DB tables should be created in advance<br />\n<br />\n<strong>06 Plan - Finalize Functionality:</strong><br />\n- The Purpose of this page is to freeze any user from making any further changes to the given Test Iteration<br />\n- On load, The form to be pre-populated with last saved configurations in read-only mode<br />\n- Authorized user should be able to traverse through all the information so far associated with the Test Iteration<br />\n- The user should be able to freeze or finalize the changes<br />\n- Once finalized, Test Iteration name should not be visible in the drop-down. In other words, User should not be able to retrieve form again.<br />\n<br />\n<em>Dependency:</em><br />\n- This can only be done against a chosen Test Iteration<br />\n- The content of this form depends on what was configured via other tabs - &ldquo;Stops&rdquo;,<br />\n&ldquo;Control-M&rdquo; and &ldquo;Feed Configuration&rdquo;.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>07 Monitor - Control/stops:</strong><br />\nOnce the user freezes the steps in iteration by doing the final step in 06 Plan - Finalize Functionality, the user will start the execution of flow of applications configured in the test iteration.<br />\n<br />\n- The Purpose of this is to Trigger execution flow of applications configured in specified Test Iteration. Control and Monitor the same<br />\n- The user will be able to choose an iteration to view the list of stops (these are the steps that were configured in 03 and 04 of planning)<br />\n- After choosing an iteration, the user will have the ability to trigger the iteration flow (start button), force complete and restart it from scratch.<br />\n<br />\nIn the list, the user will see these columns &ldquo;Status, Executions, Business Time, Scheduled Time, Name and Actions&rdquo;<br />\n- For actions column: the user will be able to start a task and if the process has started, it will have an option to &ldquo;Mark it as complete&rdquo;.

If you really need to edit an issue you must use the comments section for this (i.e. add a comment to describe any changes you want to make to the issue), and we&#39;ll decide whether the changes are major enough to move the issue to the end of the queue. You are allowed to add screen shots in the comments section though, assuming your issue report contains all the details when created.</span></span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">You must specify the test data you have used in the &#39;Reproduction Steps&#39;, All the issues will be marked as &#39;Incomplete&#39;, if the correct test data is not provided.</span></span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:12px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Keep an eye on the issues being submitted by other participants to minimize the time you may be spending on duplicate efforts.

style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:14px\">Karma is a Javascript test runner, you can use Karma to run your tests by choosing either Jasmine or Mocha as the testing framework. They are an essential part of modern software development because they allow the developer to write tests before the actual code for the feature or defects under development.&nbsp; The tests are committed to the repo along with the project source files.&nbsp; These tests are executed by the CI/ CD system to verify that the integrated code works as designed (or at least as far as it is tested). Other developers run these tests while they are coding and before deployment.&nbsp; If any of these checks fail during development,&nbsp; work halts and the focus switches to fixing the failed test.&nbsp; This new approach has lead to the continuous integration of software on a daily or even hourly basis.&nbsp;For this reason, it is imperative that the testing experience is integrated into the developer&#39;s process. Microsoft&#39;s VS code is a lightweight developer IDE that is free and has a robust ecosystem of extensions. The goal of this challenge is to create a Karma vscode extension with similar functionality as the Karma Webstorm plugin.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:source sans pro,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px\">&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</span>We have run many challenges to&nbsp;create<span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:source sans pro,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px\">&nbsp;this VSCode extension:</span>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Create Test Explorer:&nbsp;http://www.topcoder.com/challenge-details/30069929/?type=develop&amp;noncache=true</li>\n\t<li>Create Test Explorer Part 2:&nbsp;http://www.topcoder.com/challenge-details/30070440/?type=develop&amp;noncache=true</li>\n\t<li>Implement Coverage:&nbsp;http://www.topcoder.com/challenge-details/30070660/?type=develop&amp;noncache=true</li>\n\t<li>Support Angular Projects:&nbsp;http://www.topcoder.com/challenge-details/30072384/?type=develop&amp;noncache=true</li>\n\t<li>We also run many f2f tasks to make the extension support the NX Angular projects as well.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:source sans pro,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px\">You will need to go through all the challenge specifications above to learn about the Karma VSCode Extension.&nbsp;<br />\nWe will also offer $100 bonus to the developer fixed the most number of bugs.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<h2><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:16pt\">Technology Stack</span></h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">VSCode extension</span></span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Karma</span></span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Angular 4+</span></span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Nx:&nbsp;</span></span>https://nrwl.io/nx/</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><strong>Code Access</strong></h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>karma vscode gitlab repo access will be granted in the forum.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>General Requirements:</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:rgb(42, 42, 43); font-family:roboto,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size:15px\">- In this Bug Bash challenge, we are looking for your help to fix a bunch of bugs in our repo.</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:rgb(42, 42, 43); font-family:roboto,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size:15px\">- Read about Bug Bash description here:&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://help.topcoder.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002087948-What-is-a-Bug-Bash\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 15px; line-height: 25px; font-family: Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration-line: none; color: rgb(12, 78, 152); overflow-wrap: break-word;\">https://help.topcoder.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002087948-What-is-a-Bug-Bash</a><br />\n<span style=\"color:rgb(42, 42, 43); font-family:roboto,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; font-size:15px\">- The bug list will be updated frequently, we will be adding new bugs and closing bugs that you and other competitors fix.
