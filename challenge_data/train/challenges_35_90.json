In this challenge, we are looking to quickly conceptualize and design a new application meant for collaboration within a traditional factory setting. The purpose of this new collaboration tool is to create a digital experience that allows factory technicians and machine experts to be able to analyze, share and fix problems in a more efficient way. The focus of this RUX is to analyze and design the initial experiences tied to designing an application that will leverage AR Glasses (we will be using the&nbsp;realware glasses product) and Android Tablet devices. We are looking for concepts that have well-organized information architecture and clean (future) navigation for the user to have a seamless experience.<br />\n<br />\nLet us know if you have any questions!<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>What is a RUX Challenge?</strong></span><br />\nThe RUX (Rapid User Experience) challenge uses the same format as our famous LUX Challenge except it is not &quot;Live&quot; at an event. The RUX Challenge Series provides you with an opportunity to show digital leaders from some of the largest companies in the world just how good your concept and user experience (UI/UX) design skills are.<br />\n<br />\nRUX (Rapid User Experience) challenges are fast, fun, and have more chances for you to capture prize money!<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#008000\"><em>Note: You do not need to have RUX challenge experience to join this challenge - Just jump in and give it a try!

One of the items we want to focus on is this &ldquo;collaboration tool&rdquo; that will digitally enable a global network of machine/technical experts, to remotely assist maintenance technicians on the factory floor with troubleshooting and resolving machine/robotics issues. (think crowdsourcing employee expert talent to fix the machines).<br />\n<br />\n<strong>RUX Challenge Timeline and Rolling Checkpoint</strong><br />\n- Submission Start: <strong>Saturday,&nbsp;12/08/2018 at 08:00 AM EST</strong><br />\n- Rolling Checkpoint Start: <strong>Sunday,&nbsp;12/09/2018 at 20:00 PM EST</strong><br />\n- Submission End: <strong>Tuesday,&nbsp;12/11/2018 at 08:00 AM EST</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>We are offering 5 Prizes Placements</strong><br />\n1) 1st Placement: $2000<br />\n2) 2nd Placement: $1500<br />\n3) 3rd Placement: $1000<br />\n4) 4th Placement: $750<br />\n5) 5th Placement: $500<br />\n- Plus 8 placements for Rolling Checkpoint prizes @ $50 each!<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Note: Important Rolling Checkpoint Details</strong><br />\n- High-Def and adroc will answer questions and provide Rolling Feedback as fast as possible.<br />\n- You must watch the Forum for your feedback!<br />\n<em>*All initial qualifying checkpoint submissions will win $50 (Only 8 potential submissions)</em><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>User Personas</strong></span><br />\n<strong>Factory Maintenance Technician</strong> - Machine &quot;fixers&quot; who need their hands free to perform their jobs. They wear an AR headset (we will use the&nbsp;<em>realwear</em> glasses product) which acts as a HUD (heads up display) that provides necessary information and data on the machinery. They need their hands free to operate and fix the machines. The Factory technician will be reaching out and asking for assistance from the expert network as part of this collaboration tool.<br />\n<br />\nAR <em>realwear</em> Headset (<a href=\"https://www.realwear.com/\">https://www.realwear.com/</a>) is a hands-free tool based on an&nbsp;Android OS for industrial workers.&nbsp; It is a head-mounted to improve efficiency and productivity of mobile workers in hazardous environments. See <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t2gw1qoH8lViM6EWwj4Q_Z8KADDuVpK0/view?usp=sharing\">this link</a> for the glasses detail information.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Machine/Technical Experts</strong> - Our company experts who work globally and remotely away from the factories that they monitor. They are there to support the technicians with any machine issues. The devices they use is primarily tablets (as they will be mobile).&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThis collaboration tool will look to &quot;assign the best talent and available talent&quot; to the situation. They can be anywhere in the world so the collaboration tool will also provide a real-time voice translation. The experts might use different language from the technician but the collaboration tools should have the capability to translate the language real time for both of them. See <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQVQVt5H2QM\">this video</a> to get more idea/information about real-time voice translation.<br />\n<br />\n<em><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE: Vulcan has upwards of 150 factories around the worlds, a technician who receives help today can be an expert that is helping someone else tomorrow. This is an important contextual element and key to &quot;collaboration&quot;. It is important because an expert has their own routine and work within the factory they support.</strong></em><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Required Screen Features</strong></span><br />\n<strong>01) Factory Maintenance Technician (AR Realtime Headset/Glasses - Landscape view)</strong><br />\n- The realwear headset is the tool that the technician uses to gather information on the machinery that they are looking to fix. Think of it as Google glasses, which provides a Heads Up Display (HUD) for factory workers. This specific technology is android based and replaces the touch screen with an articulated micro-display, giving the appearance of a 7-inch tablet screen. See &ldquo;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t2gw1qoH8lViM6EWwj4Q_Z8KADDuVpK0/view?usp=sharing\">wireframes-1-AR-Glasses.jpg</a>&rdquo; about the glasses appearance.<br />\n<br />\n- Using this headset, the technician should be able to see and access real-time data on the machinery in the Vulcan factory hands-free, all interaction to the collaboration tool will using voice service control because they will need both hands-frees to be able to work/fixing the machine. See <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ddPN7a9fk\">this video</a> to get more ideas on how the voice service control works in this glasses.<br />\n<br />\n- They can access blueprints and troubleshooting steps from the Machine/Technical Experts<br />\n<br />\n- Show vital machine statistics that the operator needs to monitor and continue to run smoothly.&nbsp; Some examples of vitals are Leaks/Levels, Temperature, Torque, Pressure, etc.&nbsp; (Please see &ldquo;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yRR4TU1bpOSLl1AP-HaAuBZG603NyJWp/view?usp=sharing\">wireframes-2-sensor.jpg</a>&rdquo; and&nbsp; &ldquo;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/16ZPk2Prsy4vO3HJI-w9MjCFHplwIRAsI/view?usp=sharing\">wireframes-3-dashboard.jpg</a>&rdquo; for domain references)&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n- If there is an issue:&nbsp;\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">1) The technician will be able to put in a request for additional help from an expert. The collaboration tool will remotely connect them to the best option (based on the type of machine, skill, availability, and location). They should have the option to interact remotely or access someone who is local to physically come to the factor</div>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">2) They have the option to trigger an SOS that will send their request directly to the Vulcan command center. This is for emergency situations.</div>\n<br />\n- The technician will be able to send and receive all information (photos, videos) to the Expert through the AR headset. The technician can show the expert the machine condition (user our images reference for this), for example, the expert asking the technician to &quot;Show which valve to loose&quot; or &quot;Sensor readings overlaid on the machine&quot; and the technician can show it real time via photos or video through the AR glasses. See <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mvjf8VOKZy4\">this video</a> on how this thing should work in the real world.<br />\n<br />\n- Important: The Technician and Expert should be able to work together on the machine in an AR (augmented reality) way. Explore this.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>02) Machine/Technical Expert View (Tablet - Portrait View)</strong><br />\n- The ability to access information about any of the machines in any of the Vulcan factories.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n- Realize this is an expanded and more in-depth view. So think about what the expert might need in their experience that helps their workflow.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n- They will be able to see IOT device information: Leaks/Levels, Temperature, Torque, Pressure, etc. (Please see &ldquo;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yRR4TU1bpOSLl1AP-HaAuBZG603NyJWp/view?usp=sharing\">wireframes-2-sensor.jpg</a>&rdquo; and&nbsp; &ldquo;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/16ZPk2Prsy4vO3HJI-w9MjCFHplwIRAsI/view?usp=sharing\">wireframes-3-dashboard.jpg</a>&rdquo;)&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n- They can view the overall health and efficiency of any of the machines within the factories.<br />\n<br />\n- Should have the ability to access the camera on the technician&#39;s headset to view from their perspective.<br />\n<br />\n- Can send/receive photos and videos to the technician<br />\n<br />\n- Has the ability to communicate with the technician with audio, video, and text (chat) communication.<br />\n<br />\n- Audio will use real-time voice translation for communication globally. So, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what language the experts and technician using, it will be translated real time to their native language.&nbsp;See <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQVQVt5H2QM\">this video</a> to get more idea/information&nbsp;about real-time voice translation.<br />\n<br />\n- The expert should be able to do a remote connection to the machine, Expert connects to machine IP, works on the Command Line, PLC config etc and while he is doing it participants of the session can see it (Technician can see it on the AR glasses)<br />\n<br />\n- Important Note: We will see more of the &quot;collaboration&quot; tool from the Tablet device view (and history of collaboration). Realize we are focused on the initial two users and the tool will be explored more in the future challenges.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>03) Additional Features</strong><br />\n- As a designer any additional thoughts or features you would like to showcase?<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong>04) Presentation Screen - 1920x1080 (16:9 Ratio)</strong><br />\n- In a RUX challenge, this screen is the way to showcase your concept so keep it simple and make it look good!<br />\n- If you were walking into a meeting and needed to sell your idea - use this screen to showcase your concept.</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 255)\"><strong>Important Concepts to be captured in this challenge</strong></span><br />\n1) Hands-free<br />\n2) AR (augmented reality) enabled<br />\n- Show me which valve is loose<br />\n- Sensor readings overlaid on the machine<br />\n3)&nbsp;Real-time voice translation<br />\n4) Remote connection to the machine<br />\n- Expert connects to machine IP, works on the Command Line, PLC config etc and while he is doing it participants of the session can see it.<br />\n-&nbsp;A technician&nbsp;can see it on the AR glass.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Branding Guidelines</strong></span><br />\n- Follow our branding guidelines for fonts, colors, and style&nbsp;<br />\n- Think about target users and type of devices that they will be wearing (glasses and tablet)<br />\n- Avoid contrasts that are too hard and too light<br />\n- Futuristic UI&#39;s are okay! This is conceptual..so color, icons, the voice services (control and translation) is critical to helping the user quickly get answers.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<span

- Marathon Match New System Improvements","description":"Welcome to Topcoder - Marathon Match New System Improvements.<br />\n&nbsp;\n<h3><strong>Contest Details</strong></h3>\n&nbsp;\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>We are creating a new processor to handle Marathon Matches challenges based on NodeJs 8.x.</li>\n\t<li>We have already created the new scoring system - <a href=\"https://github.com/topcoder-platform/mm-processor/tree/develop\">https://github.com/topcoder-platform/mm-processor/tree/develop</a>.</li>\n\t<li>Now we need to make some improvements to the existing system.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<h3><strong>Project Background</strong></h3>\n&nbsp;\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Topcoder is updating its API and one of the APIs being updated is the Submission API.</li>\n\t<li>One of the scenarios that we are taking care of here is that when a user uploads a submission to Topcoder for a Marathon Match challenge.</li>\n\t<li>An app (not relevant for this contest) creates a message that contains details about this submission and sends it to an Apache Kafka instance.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div>\n<h3><strong><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Technology Stack</span></strong></h3>\n&nbsp;\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Nodejs</li>\n\t<li>Kafka</li>\n\t<li>Java,&nbsp;C#, and C++</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n\n<h3><strong>Individual Requirements</strong></h3>\n&nbsp;\n\n<ul>\n</ul>\n</div>\n1. Add to the system the ability to accept custom Gradle build script for Java submission to allow external dependencies. One possible solution is to make the Gradle template project expect another subproject called s<strong>ubmission</strong>. Inside this subproject and add an empty Gradle file that can be overwritten by a file coming from the member submission zip file.<br />\n<br />\n2. Ability to have a<strong>&nbsp;formula</strong>&nbsp;as a part of <strong>Verification</strong> object in DynamoDB. This formula will be used to calculate the score of the submission for each input. A library like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://silentmatt.com/javascript-expression-evaluator/\">https://silentmatt.com/javascript-expression-evaluator/</a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"http://mathjs.org/examples/expressions.js.html\">http://mathjs.org/examples/expressions.js.html</a>&nbsp;can be used to implement this feature. Eventually, the verification script will be fixed and only the formula to calculate the score will be configurable. The formula will take into account the submission output and optionally the provided output, the max memory and the execution time.<br />\n<br />\n3. The final score for each submission should be calculated. This will be the average of the score for all inputs.<br />\n<br />\n4. After the final score is calculated, the Submission API must be called&nbsp;to create the&nbsp;<strong>review</strong>&nbsp;record. The submission endpoint to be used to create review is &quot;<strong>POST</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://api.topcoder-dev.com/v5/reviews\">http://api.topcoder-dev.com/v5/reviews</a>&quot;. The swagger can be found here&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tc-submission-api-dev.herokuapp.com/docs/#/Reviews/createReview\">https://tc-submission-api-dev.herokuapp.com/docs/#/Reviews/createReview</a>.<br />\n<br />\nThe endpoint is protected by JWT token. See example here <a href=\"https://github.com/topcoder-platform/legacy-sub-processor/blob/develop/src/services/NewSubmissionService.js\">https://github.com/topcoder-platform/legacy-sub-processor/blob/develop/src/services/NewSubmissionService.js</a>&nbsp;on how to post to submission endpoint.<br />\n<br />\n5. Existing Marathon Match scoring system has two input types - Normal and System Tests. The new system must also support that. You must:<br />\n<br />\na) Add to the Verification object two new properties called <strong>systemInputs</strong> and <strong>systemOutputs.</strong>&nbsp;They will hold the system test inputs and optional outputs.<br />\n<br />\nb) Detect which input type should be used by listening to Kafka messages. If coming from Submission API (current implementation) use normal test inputs if coming from Auto Pilot use system test inputs. The AutoPilot Kafka message is detailed below:\n<ul>\n\t<li>topic:&nbsp;notifications.autopilot.events</li>\n\t<li>originator:&nbsp;auto_pilot</li>\n\t<li>payload (<strong><em><span style=\"font-size:12px\">phaseTypeName = &quot;Review&quot;, state = &quot;START&quot;, projectId = &quot;&lt;challengeId&gt;&quot;</span></em></strong>).

for easy, transparent integration with Gitlab and Github for managing tasks on Topcoder through Gitlab and Github issues. &nbsp;Each issue on Gitlab or Github will be automatically associated with a specific challenge on Topcoder and this challenge will be updated automatically for assignee, prize, etc... and it will be opened and closed for payment as the Gitlab or Github ticket is opened, modified, and closed.</span></span></li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent\">This challenge is part of a long-term series

This technique commonly known as data caching leverages Redis, however, to manage Redis users must become familiar with the Redis command line interface (CLI). Since the end users do not use Redis enough to become proficient with the CLI, we&rsquo;ve been asked to make a management app for them.</span><br />\n&nbsp;\n<h3><strong>Assets</strong></h3>\n<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Please clone the repo here. </span><a href=\"https://github.com/topcoderinc/TC-redis-manager\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">https://github.com/topcoderinc/TC-redis-manager</span></a>\n\n<h3><strong>Technology Stack</strong></h3>\n<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Frontend</span>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong><span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Angular 7 (see scope)</span></span></strong></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Angular Material https://material.angular.io/</span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Material Icons https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Backend</span>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">ioredis</span><a href=\"https://github.com/luin/ioredis\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\"> </span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">https://github.com/luin/ioredis</span></a></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Hapi.js</span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">NodeJS</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><br />\n<strong>What to Test (Scope)</strong></h3>\n<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">We have run several challenges to build this app. Please go through all the challenges specifications and test that all the features are included and work.<br />\n<span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong>Major Requirement: We need Angular updated to Angular 7.

If you really need to edit an issue you must use the comments section for this (i.e. add a comment to describe any changes you want to make to the issue), and we&#39;ll decide whether the changes are major enough to move the issue to the end of the queue. You are allowed to add screen shots in the comments section though, assuming your issue report contains all the details when created.</span></span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">You must specify the test data you have used in the &#39;Reproduction Steps&#39;, All the issues will be marked as &#39;Incomplete&#39;, if the correct test data is not provided.</span></span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Keep an eye on the issues being submitted by other participants to minimize the time you may be spending on duplicate efforts.

If you submit the same bug in multiple areas/pages, (for instance, Same validation issue of a form can be found in different pages/sections) you will likely get credit for the original bug report only. The others will all be closed as duplicates.</li>\n\t<li>If you duplicate an issue on a platform or browser that hasn&rsquo;t been tested yet, you should create a new issue and add a link/reference in the issue description to the existing issue number. Our copilot will review these items and consolidate them later.

Others will be marked as DUPLICATE.</li>\n\t<li>You must not edit the bug report once created, so make sure you enter all the details at the time you create the issue, otherwise, your issue will be moved to the end of the queue. If you really need to edit an issue you must use the comments section for this (i.e. add a comment to describe any changes you want to make to the issue), and we&#39;ll decide whether the changes are major enough to move the issue to the end of the queue. You are allowed to add screen shots in the comments section though, assuming your issue report contains all the details when created.</li>\n\t<li>You must specify the test data you have used in the &#39;Reproduction Steps&#39;, All the issues will be marked as &#39;Incomplete&#39;, if the correct test data is not provided.</li>\n\t<li>Keep an eye on the issues being submitted by other participants to minimize the time you may be spending on duplicate efforts. Knowing what has already been reported will allow you to better focus your time on finding yet undiscovered issues.</li>\n\t<li><strong>There will be no appeals phase.

Identify, split and create them properly.&nbsp;</strong></li>\n\t<li>Pages reused by admin/user:</li>\n\t<li>-- Login - both roles use same UI for login.</li>\n\t<li>-- Reports - both roles use it. The user sees filtered data to only own reports but UI is the same.</li>\n\t<li>-- Economic Calculator - both users&amp;admins can work it with full functionality.</li>\n\t<li>SCSS mixins should be created for components like buttons, forms, panels. We need to be able to modify all generic components globally.</li>\n\t<li>All data should be loaded from JSON files <strong>not hard-coded in HTML or JS</strong>. We will have integration challenge when backend ready to connect UI with API.</li>\n\t<li>Charts/diagrams are in scope. D3 is the preferred library to use but we are open for suggestions as well.</li>\n\t<li>Keep in mind that UI(with charts) will be updated in real-time as the user interacts with the application interface.</li>\n\t<li>The application should configure and implement proper routing via the Angular router. Should enforce security via route guards. As we do not have back-end yet please use a simple file to configure users/admins.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Individual Requirements(Major)</h2>\n<strong>1. Login - Screens: 1_1_Login.png -&nbsp;1_4_Login.png(Admin+User)</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Used for login with email/password</li>\n\t<li>Route path: /login - free for access for anyone</li>\n\t<li>Should implement validation and error messages as per design</li>\n\t<li>Click &quot;Login&quot; redirect to the user&#39;s or admin&#39;s dashboard based on user&#39;s role</li>\n\t<li>Slider to the left can hardcode images and text</li>\n\t<li>&quot;FORGOT PASSWORD&quot; form is missing in design. Please use the same look and feel to implement it. It should be a simple form. Email field with a button(&quot;RESET PASSWORD&quot;)</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>2. Admin Dashboard -&nbsp;Screens:&nbsp;2_1_Dashboard.png - 2_7_Dashboard.png</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>This is what the Admin see after login.</li>\n\t<li>Route path: /dashboard&nbsp;- only access for admins</li>\n\t<li>&quot;Economic Calculator&quot; tab(left) sidebar is the same as the User sees/interacts with. The idea is that Admins can also do/use the calculator in full functionality.</li>\n\t<li>Use mock data for questions, answers, charts.</li>\n\t<li>All components on the dashboard should be functional.</li>\n\t<li>We do <strong>not </strong>track download time of reports thus week/period selectors from both download charts are to be left out from implementation.</li>\n\t<li>Charts should be functional.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>3. Admin Reports -&nbsp; Screens: 3_1_Report.png -&nbsp;3_5_Report.png</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Used by admins to manage reports.</li>\n\t<li>Route path: /reports&nbsp;- only access for admins/users</li>\n\t<li>Use mock data for the tables/tabs.</li>\n\t<li>Pagination will be implemented on the back-end side but should demo it in the prototype.</li>\n\t<li>Modal pops up when the user clicks the email icon. 3_4_Report@2x.png is wrong. No need to have &quot;File Name&quot; and type dropdown just do not implement them.</li>\n\t<li>This view is used by the user as well. The same component but user role sees only reports created from the user itself, not all reports as present to the admin.</li>\n\t<li>We have only 2 states of reports. &quot;Complete&quot; and &quot;Incomplete&quot;. Therefore need only 3 tabs &quot;All&quot;,&nbsp;&quot;Complete&quot; and &quot;Incomplete&quot; not as shown in the design.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>4. Admin User Management - Screens: 4_1_User_Management.png</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<strong>4_3_User_Management.png</strong>&nbsp;\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Used by admin to manage users in the system</li>\n\t<li>Route path: /users&nbsp;- only access for admins</li>\n\t<li>Use mock data for the tables/tabs.</li>\n\t<li>Pagination will be implemented on the back-end side but should demo it in the prototype.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>5. Admin Data - Screens: 5_1_Admin.png -&nbsp;5_7_Admin.png</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Used by admins to create/update questions in master sets of data.</li>\n\t<li>Route path: /data&nbsp;- only access for admins</li>\n\t<li>Each group of questions is editable via modal. All those modals have similar look and feel and need to be implemented.</li>\n\t<li>Use mock data but show all kind of question types.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>6. User Dashboard &nbsp;- Screens:&nbsp;2_1_Dashboard.png</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>User sees it after login to the application</li>\n\t<li>Route path: /dashboard&nbsp;- only access for users</li>\n\t<li>Could be/use the same component as admin dashboard but with hidden sections that are not allowed to users OR separated page/view</li>\n\t<li>Use mock data to create and demo it.</li>\n\t<li>The filtering on &quot;Customer Report Status&quot;(cog icon) is in scope and should match look and feel like admin&#39;s&nbsp;2_6_Dashboard.png with same fields plus a &quot;Status&quot; one.</li>\n\t<li>We do&nbsp;<strong>not&nbsp;</strong>track download time of reports thus week/period selectors from download chart are to be left out from implementation.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>7. User/Admin Economic Calculator - Screens: 3_0_1_Economic_Calculator .png -&nbsp;3_20_Economic_Calculator .png</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>User and admins use it to create ASoD reports based on master data sets and customer inputs.</li>\n\t<li>Route path: /calculator - only access for admins/users</li>\n\t<li>When this tab is hit for the 1st time there is customer selection flow. It should be implemented.</li>\n\t<li>Click on the back arrow left to user&#39;s avatar in Economic Calculator should reset the selected customer and bring app back to customer selection.</li>\n\t<li>Use mock data to create and demo.</li>\n\t<li>All components are in scope.</li>\n\t<li>No need to implement update in real-time for the charts but those should be &quot;real&quot; charts, not placeholder images.</li>\n\t<li>We suggest D3 as chart library but are open for suggestions as well.</li>\n\t<li>All modals involved should be created as separate components.</li>\n\t<li>Question hint popups are in scope too.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Browser Requirements</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>IE11+, Edge</li>\n\t<li>Latest Google Chrome (Windows &amp; Mac OS).</li>\n\t<li>Latest Safari (Windows &amp; Mac OS).</li>\n\t<li>Latest Firefox (Windows &amp; Mac OS).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\nScreen Specifications</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>We target desktop screens only</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\nHTML Requirements</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>HTML should be valid HTML5 compliant.</li>\n\t<li>Provide comments on the page elements to give a clear explanation of the code usage.

Career Site - Job Search Zeta Components","description":"<div>\n<h3><strong>Challenge Objectives</strong></h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Custom CMS (content management system) called Zeta, Yelp API, basic HTML / Javascript</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">This challenge will be a proof of concept to show that we can build Zeta CMS &ldquo;components&rdquo; that call a job search API and show the results.&nbsp; Separate components will be built for the search input and displaying the results.</span></li>\n\t<li>���We&#39;ve built a similar component recently for Yelp, and this challenge can use that to see how we can implement the new search components.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><strong>Project Background</strong></h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">We will be building out a few sites that use Zeta and provide new functionality for the client.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">This challenge will show that we can do what the client is going to need, as well as properly deploy and use the Zeta CMS.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">We will be building a map component based on the jobs API after this, so there will be multiple challenges using this jobs API and using the jobs components.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><strong>Technology Stack</strong></h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Zeta is built on Node.js, MongoDB, and MySQL</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Zeta is tough to deploy by itself, so we have provided a Vagrant setup that should be easily deployable through `vagrant up`</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Details on deployment and the test user to use at login will be provided in the forum</span></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><strong>Individual requirements</strong></h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">For this challenge, we will build and deploy two Zeta components, detailed below. &nbsp;A Zeta developer guide will be provided as part of the Vagrant deployment Git repository to help guide members.</span></p>\n\n<p>The requirements can be found in this ticket:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/hercules-jobs/project-resources-jobs/issues/14\">https://gitlab.com/hercules-jobs/project-resources-jobs/issues/14</a><br />\n<br />\nAccess to the Gitlab repo can be found in the forum.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Search API&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The job service should be integrated into the service-static app in the Zeta deploy, allowing for global usage from future components. &nbsp;See the&nbsp;</span><strong>Services API</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">&nbsp;section of the Zeta developer guide.</span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>UI Requirements:</strong></p>\n\n<p><font color=\"#000000\" face=\"arial\"><span style=\"font-size:14.6667px\">Your components should follow the UI given in the MarvelApp links in the ticket above.&nbsp; Existing components do this already, and you can use those components to help implement these new ones.</span></font><br />\n<br />\n<strong>General guidelines:</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Our Zeta resources (see the developers guide) will follow the existing naming convention and will be called&nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-family:courier new; font-size:11pt\">project-resources-jobs</span></p>\n\n<h3><strong>Deployment guide and validation document</strong></h3>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Make sure to require two separate documents for validation.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">A README.md that covers:</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Deployment: &nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">How the components are installed in Zeta, added to a DocDef, and then shown on a document.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Configuration: &nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">How do we configure the API details for the search API?</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Dependency installation: &nbsp;</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">What new dependencies are required and how are they installed?</span></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">A Validation.md that covers:</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">How the deployed components are used, showing a couple test cases, including errors.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Validation video / screencast</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">A video is required for this challenge.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><strong>What To Submit</strong></h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Component code as patch files to the existing repositories in Gitlab.&nbsp; Please target a commit hash and document the hash in your README so that reviewers can apply the patch easily.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Make sure to test your patch files!</strong></span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">README.md</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span

They are an essential part of modern software development because they allow the developer to write tests before the actual code for the feature or defects under development.&nbsp; The tests are committed to the repo along with the project source files.&nbsp; These tests are executed by the CI/ CD system to verify that the integrated code works as designed (or at least as far as it is tested). Other developers run these tests while they are coding and before deployment.&nbsp; If any of these checks fail during development,&nbsp; work halts and the focus switches to fixing the failed test.&nbsp; This new approach has lead to the continuous integration of software on a daily or even hourly basis.&nbsp;For this reason, it is imperative that the testing experience is integrated into the developer&#39;s process. Microsoft&#39;s VS code is a lightweight developer IDE that is free and has a robust ecosystem of extensions. The goal of this challenge is to create a Karma vscode extension with similar functionality as the Karma Webstorm plugin.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\nWe have run many challenges to create this VSCode extension:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Create Test Explorer:&nbsp;http://www.topcoder.com/challenge-details/30069929/?type=develop&amp;noncache=true</li>\n\t<li>Create Test Explorer Part 2:&nbsp;http://www.topcoder.com/challenge-details/30070440/?type=develop&amp;noncache=true</li>\n\t<li>Implement Coverage:&nbsp;http://www.topcoder.com/challenge-details/30070660/?type=develop&amp;noncache=true</li>\n\t<li>Support Angular Projects:&nbsp;http://www.topcoder.com/challenge-details/30072384/?type=develop&amp;noncache=true</li>\n\t<li>We also run many f2f tasks to make the extension support the NX Angular projects as well.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:16pt\">Technology Stack</span></h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">VSCode extension</span></span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Karma</span></span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Angular 4+</span></span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Nx:&nbsp;</span></span>https://nrwl.io/nx/</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\n<span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:16pt\">Code access</span></h2>\nPlease request the gitlab&nbsp;repo access in the forum.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;\n<h2><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:16pt\">Individual requirements</span></h2>\nPlease update the README.md&nbsp;to create a user guide similar as the one for Mocha-Sidebar VSCode Extension:&nbsp; https://github.com/maty21/mocha-sidebar.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe followings are required:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Overview</li>\n\t<li>GIFs to demonstrate the major features of the Karma VSCode Extension, and a video if it&#39;s more helpful.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>List of features supported by this extension</li>\n\t<li>Known issues - other than the similar Coverage issue as the Mocha-Sidebar, it also has the following issue:&nbsp;\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>When I click &lsquo;debug&rsquo; the first time for specific test, the breakpoint is just skipped, but then if click it a 2nd time, the breakpoint works.<br />\n\t\tThis is because breakpoints set before the debugger launches are not hit.<br />\n\t\tVSCode actually fixes this here &lt;a&gt;https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/12/20/chrome-debugging#_breakpoints-set-before-your-app-runs&lt;/a&gt; but it only works if Chrome is launched by VSCode Debugger. It allows a breakOnLoad option inside launch.json for the chrome config with &ldquo;launch&rdquo;<br />\n\t\tBut for the extension, karma launches chrome so launch.json has chrome config with &ldquo;attach&rdquo; which does not allow a breakOnLoad option.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>FAQ</li>\n\t<li>Configuration</li>\n\t<li>Usage</li>\n\t<li>How it works</li>\n</ul>\nNote that this

For this project, we are going to run a series of prototype challenges to build a web based UI for the tool.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Challenge Objectives</strong><br />\nThere&rsquo;s an important module called SLD (Single Line Diagram) editor in the tool, which is an editor used to create diagrams.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nIn the previous challenges, we have implemented the basic functions of the SLD editor using GoJS and a demo web app in Angular.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nFor the purpose of this challenge, we need to take another step forward to make it more production ready. Please keep reading to find out more details.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Technology Stack</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>GoJS</li>\n\t<li>AngularJS 6</li>\n\t<li>HTML5</li>\n\t<li>Javascript</li>\n\t<li>CSS</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Challenge Requirements</strong><br />\n<strong>Max Connections</strong><br />\nPlease carefully check section 4.1 of the spec and update the implementation to make sure each widget will only have the mentioned max number of connections.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Unique Key</strong><br />\nEach added widget will need to have a unique key to be saved in the sldReference in the json . This field is readonly and cannot not be modified. Note you may use the auto generated label as the unique key if label is garanteed to be unique, but keep in mind that label can be modified but the key (sldReference) can NOT.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Connector Stability</strong><br />\nRight now in the tool when we drag widgets around in editor they change their connector (top to bottom, left to right, or vice versa). This shouldn&rsquo;t be happening since connector points are supposed to be stable and no matter how we drag the widgets the connector points should not automatically switch to other ones in the same widget. Even though this sometimes results in overlaps of lines / widgets but that&rsquo;s fine.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nFor example, this is wrong since the connector point moved: <u><a href=\"http://take.ms/rq8fC\">http://take.ms/rq8fC</a></u><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>JSON Representation of SLD</strong><br />\nThe major focus of this challenge is to create and maintain the json representation of the SLD.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nFirst, each type of widget should have a template of json fields that will indicate the fields the widget can have, please check <em><u>GetAssetProprtyById.json</u></em> for an example. For now, assume all widgets will have the same fields, but you have keep a separate template file for each type of widget instead of sharing a common one since we&rsquo;ll shortly replace some of them with templates containing different fields. Whenever a widget is added, it will have a copy of the fields from its template and its values for the fields (most of these values will be editable soon so it&rsquo;s important that different widgets of the same type have their own copies of data).<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nWhenever a new SLD is created, a json file that follows the structure of <em><u>GetSustationById.json</u></em> should be created, for empty diagrams this json will not have meaningful values for the fields, but as more widgets are added to the diagram, this json must be updated real time. There are some key fields in this JSON that must be manipulated by this tool:\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>&quot;seralizedSld&quot;: under this key you should save all information (widgets, their positions, connections, etc.) of the SLD so that you can reconstruct the exact diagram from this field later.</li>\n\t<li>&ldquo;busbars&rdquo;: for any busbar widgets added to the SLD, they should be added to the &ldquo;busbars&rdquo; field, the fields for a busbar widget will be copied from the template for that type of widget.</li>\n\t<li>&ldquo;psLs&rdquo;: for any power supply (power supply and motor) and load widgets added to the SLD, they should be added to the &ldquo;psLs&rdquo; field, the fields for a power supply or load widget will be copied from the template for that type of widget.</li>\n\t<li>&ldquo;allComponents&rdquo;: any other added widgets fall under this field in the SLD, again the fields will be copied from the template for that type of widget.\n\t<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\n\t\t<li>Please note that ideal cable is a special component not present in the widgets panel, it actually refers to the line that connects two widgets. So for example: say there are 4 components and 6 lines connecting them, we&rsquo;d have 6 ideal cable components in the json. We should also have a template of fields for ideal cable, and such fields should be copied to the json whenever a new connection is made.</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>For each of the widget we must make sure the &ldquo;sldReference&rdquo; field refers to the unique name of that widget.</li>\n\t<li>For each of the widget that can have no more than 2 connections, we need to update the &ldquo;connectedComponentsFirst&rdquo; and &ldquo;connectedComponentsSecond&rdquo; fields to refer to the connected widgets.</li>\n\t<li>For each of the widget that can have more than 2 connections, we need to update the &ldquo;connectedComponentsList&rdquo; field to refer to all the connected widgets.</li>\n\t<li>&ldquo;outageAreasList&rdquo;: this field contains all outage areas in the SLD.</li>\n\t<li>Please note this json structure must be kept in sync with the SLD at all times, meaning it&rsquo;s an exact representation of the diagram.</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Menus</strong><br />\nWe need to update the menus to meet our requirements. Please note that any menu / sub-menu not mentioned below should be removed.<br />\n&nbsp;\n<ol>\n\t<li>Equipment registry: no changes needed.</li>\n\t<li>Configuration:\n\t<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\n\t\t<li>Import SLD: this will import the exported json file and re-create the exact diagram from which the json was exported.</li>\n\t\t<li>Export SLD: this will export the in-memory json structure to a json file that the user can save to the local file system.</li>\n\t\t<li>Import equipment data: no changes needed.</li>\n\t\t<li>Export equipment data: no changes needed.</li>\n\t\t<li>Export SLD as image: no changes needed.</li>\n\t\t<li>Print Diagram: no changes needed.</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Edit:\n\t<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\n\t\t<li>Select all: no changes</li>\n\t\t<li>Rotate: no changes</li>\n\t\t<li>Toggle: switches to the next state</li>\n\t\t<li>Delete: no changes</li>\n\t\t<li>Cut: no changes</li>\n\t\t<li>Copy: no changes</li>\n\t\t<li>Paste: no changes</li>\n\t\t<li>Undo: no changes</li>\n\t\t<li>Redo: no changes</li>\n\t\t<li>Reset label positions: no changes</li>\n\t\t<li>Alignment: no changes</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>View:\n\t<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\n\t\t<li>Show in full screen: turn the browser into full screen mode</li>\n\t\t<li>Show grid: no changes</li>\n\t\t<li>Show labels: no changes</li>\n\t\t<li>View information explorer: no changes</li>\n\t\t<li>Color connected component: on click all connected component will be highlighted</li>\n\t\t<li>Shade by outage area: right now outage areas are created as colored rectangles, that&rsquo;s not right, we need to update the implementation such that outage areas are invisible by default, and by checking this menu all outage areas will show up. And instead of whole blue box we should just show it with a blue border only.</li>\n\t\t<li>Shade by impact area: no changes for now</li>\n\t\t<li>Shade by risk area: no changes for now</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Zoom: no changes</li>\n\t<li>Analysis - keep all sub-menus disabled except for the below mentioned ones:\n\t<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\n\t\t<li>Assign reliability data: this menu will trigger the app to read some values from a local json files and update these fields into the selected widget&rsquo;s data, the update will happen in background but once done a toast saying &quot;reliability data updated&quot; should be shown. The reliability data json will have 3 fields which will be updated into widget data: condition, importance and risk.</li>\n\t\t<li>Simulate clear fault: this menu will work like the same context menu but we need some updates to it. Right now it&rsquo;s only changing the color of the selected widget, we need to update it so that it changes the color of&nbsp; all connected components as well. Besides, such color changes should be updated into the json structure in real time. Similarly when user clicks somewhere else the colors will be reverted, and in such case the json structure needs to be updated in real time as well.</li>\n\t\t<li>Simulate isolate fault: same as above</li>\n\t\t<li>Simulate isolate for maintenance: same as above</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Help:\n\t<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\n\t\t<li>Key shortcuts: show a popup that lists all keyboard shortcuts for all operations</li>\n\t\t<li>Help: no changes</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Context Menus</strong>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Reliability figures: right now this menu shows a popup with static info. In this challenge please update this menu to pull the following fields from the json data associated with the widget instead:\n\t<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\n\t\t<li>condition</li>\n\t\t<li>importance</li>\n\t\t<li>risk</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Simulate clear fault: same changes as the one mentioned in the Menu section</li>\n\t<li>Simulate isolate fault: same changes as the one mentioned in the Menu section</li>\n\t<li>Simulate isolate for maintenance: same changes as the one mentioned in the Menu section</li>\n\t<li>Edit Metadata: right now 3 of the widgets support metadata editing, we need to make sure that:\n\t<ol>\n\t\t<li>on the edit metadata popup, change the Serial Number field to SLD Reference, and make it readonly (read from the json)</li>\n\t\t<li>when the edit metadata popup shows up, it shows values for the fields from the data of that equipment</li>\n\t\t<li>when user changes and saves any of the field values, they should be updated into the json so the exported json will always have the most up to date values.</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>General Requirements</strong><br />\nThe following requirements should already be covered in the previous challenge, just make sure you don&rsquo;t break any of them:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Make this editor reusable as an Angular 6 component, and demonstrate this using an Angular 6 based web app. We plan to integrate this editor into another bigger Angular 6 web app later so making it reusable / easy to integrate is important.</li>\n\t<li>You don&rsquo;t have to worry too much about the overall look &amp; feel of the editor / web app, just make sure the above mentioned features are working properly on a simple UI.</li>\n\t<li>You are expected to create a detailed README file including information on how to setup, run and verify your application.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>HTML Requirements</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>HTML should be valid HTML5 compliant.</li>\n\t<li>Provide comments on the page elements to give clear explanation of the code usage.

&quot;</span><strong>ASoD Economic Calculator App - Swagger REST API Implementation #2</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">&quot;. Application Security on Demand (ASoD) is a service that we offer to our customer and currently, we use a manual excel document as an &ldquo;Economic calculator&rdquo; to calculate the economic benefit to our customer. In this series of challenges, we convert the excel application to web application.<br />\n<br />\nThis challenge aims to implement the back-end API project that will support the&nbsp;</span>ASoD Economic Calculator App.\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 0)\">In part #2 we are implementing the</span><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 0)\">&nbsp;calculation logic of the application and finishing back-end specification.</span></p>\n\n<h2><strong>Technology Stack</strong></h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>NodeJS</li>\n\t<li>MongoDB</li>\n\t<li>MongooseJS</li>\n\t<li>Express</li>\n\t<li>Swagger</li>\n\t<li>Heroku</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><strong>Code base</strong></h2>\nWinning submission from <a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/30075466/\">back-end #1</a> challenge will be provided in the forum.\n\n<h2><strong>Individual Requirements(all major)</strong></h2>\nFollow the existing&nbsp;code and implementation style as used by the codebase.<br />\n<strong>Refer to the architecture model(provided in the forum) and ask questions forum to clear issues found.</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>1. Implement missing models</strong>&nbsp;<strong>from the ERD/Swagger</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Answer</li>\n\t<li>Report</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>2. Extract and generate initial&nbsp;data for the application</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>We will use the src/init-data.js script to populate database initially. Therefore update it to:</li>\n\t<li>Keep the 3 users created (admin/user/client)</li>\n\t<li>Create <strong>2 </strong><strong>questionMaster</strong><strong>&nbsp;records. 1st named - &quot;User input&quot; and 2nd named - &quot;Master data&quot;</strong></li>\n\t<li>Open the provided excel and extract all questions asked to the user (&quot;Input Form&quot; B3:C13 and E column) as question&nbsp;records and associate them to&nbsp;<strong>1st named - &quot;User input&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;master set.</strong></li>\n\t<li>There is docs/example-question.json file that is the begin of the extraction. Refer to it as a starting point and help to understand what is expected.</li>\n\t<li>All user questions should be properly extracted with all fields populated. Keep track of question&#39;s &quot;calRef&quot; and answer&#39;s &quot;calRef&quot; as we will need them later for calculation the model</li>\n\t<li>Extract all master data to questions and associate them to&nbsp;<strong>2nd named - &quot;Master data&quot;</strong> .&nbsp;To do so follow the principle: <strong>Extract all simple values not formulas needed for calculation.</strong></li>\n\t<li>There is&nbsp;&nbsp;docs/example-masterquestion.json&nbsp;file that is the begin of the extraction. Refer to it as a starting point and help to understand what is expected. See how the last column(F26:F27) is omitted as it is a reference. Such references/formulas we will need to calculate if the &quot;CalculatedReferences&quot; model used by the /model/calculate endpoint described below.</li>\n\t<li>The general idea is to give admins high flexibility to edit/modify user questions and master data. Also, add new questions at some later point.</li>\n\t<li>For the review please make sure all data is correct with proper calRefs.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>3. Implement&nbsp;Swagger specification</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Complete/implement the missing APIs from the swagger spec.</li>\n\t<li>Reports - used to create/update/get reports. Reports have states. Report is complete when there are answers&nbsp;from the user/client to all questions in&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;1st named - &quot;User input&quot; questionMaster</strong>&nbsp;otherwise it is an incomplete state.</li>\n\t<li>POST /model/calculate - is the heart of the applucation and will ge called each time user/admin changes input.</li>\n\t<li>POST /model/calculate - based on provided &quot;answers&quot; and saved questions/master data it will need to calculate both &quot;<span style=\"color:rgb(80, 80, 80); font-family:sans-serif; font-size:16px\">CalculatedResult</span>&quot; and &quot;CalculatedReferences&quot; schemas. Use the excel file to extract the calculation formulas and link to the question/master data by &quot;calcRef&quot; fields.</li>\n\t<li>For example: to calculate&nbsp;CalculatedReferences.Data:F2 app needs to check if there is an answer in the payload to the user question with calcRef=&quot;Input Form:C3&quot;. If yes then take its value&nbsp;for &quot;Risk Factor&quot; if there is not answer then equal 0.</li>\n\t<li>Please, ask in forum if any calculation needs to be discussed.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>4. Update documentation</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>README.md&nbsp;- describing the following sections: Prerequisites, Installation/Deployment(also on Heroku),&nbsp;Configuration, Starting, Developing</li>\n\t<li>Validation.md&nbsp;- describing how to validate your submission</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\nReview phase</h2>\n<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 0)\">This project has a faster&nbsp;review(24h) phase.

They are an essential part of modern software development because they allow the developer to write tests before the actual code for the feature or defects under development.&nbsp; The tests are committed to the repo along with the project source files.&nbsp; These tests are executed by the CI/ CD system to verify that the integrated code works as designed (or at least as far as it is tested). Other developers run these tests while they are coding and before deployment.&nbsp; If any of these checks fail during development,&nbsp; work halts and the focus switches to fixing the failed test.&nbsp; This new approach has lead to the continuous integration of software on a daily or even hourly basis.&nbsp;For this reason, it is imperative that the testing experience is integrated into the developer&#39;s process. Microsoft&#39;s VS code is a lightweight developer IDE that is free and has a robust ecosystem of extensions. The goal of this challenge is to create a Karma vscode extension with similar functionality as the Karma Webstorm plugin.&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:source sans pro,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px\">&nbsp;</span>\n\n<h2><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:16pt\">Technology Stack</span></h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">vscode extension</span></span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Karma</span></span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Angular 7</span></span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Nx:&nbsp;</span></span>https://nrwl.io/nx/</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\n<span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:16pt\">Code access</span></h2>\n<span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:source sans pro,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">The codebase will be provided in the forum.&nbsp;</span></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:source sans pro,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px\">&nbsp;</span>\n\n<h2><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:16pt\">Individual requirements</span></h2>\nWhen we load the tmo-one-site in the karma vscode extension, and select an app to run the tests, it will report the following error:<br />\nUnknown option: &#39;--karma-config&#39;<br />\nUnknown option: &#39;--source-map&#39;<br />\n<br />\nWhile these options are supported by the angular-cli&nbsp;actually, we want you to investigate and fix the issue.&nbsp;<br />\nNote that it&#39;s not related to the karma vscode&nbsp;extension, if you run command&nbsp;in the tmo-one-site directly like:&nbsp; ng test &quot;shop-client&quot; --karma-config=&quot;xxx&quot; --source-map, the same error will occur.

- DViz Executive Dashboard Tableau Design Concepts Challenge","description":"Welcome to the <strong>Tiger</strong> -&nbsp;<strong>DViz Executive Dashboard Tableau Design Concepts Challenge</strong>!<br />\n<br />\nIn this challenge, we are looking to design an executive dashboard for tracking Contingent Staff Performance. This is done by capturing and visualizing all the Key Performance Indicators (KPI&#39;s) of monthly contingent staffing data that will be fetched from multiple sources (databases).<br />\n<br />\nThis Data Visualization executive dashboard will eventually be implemented on the Tableau platform. This first challenge is only to design the DViz dashboard experience and focusing on a great Tableau experience.<br />\n<br />\nI am really excited to kick off this challenge and continuing the Topcoder focus on creating great data visualization experiences.\n<h3 class='roundLabel'>Round 1</h3><p>Submit your initial designs for a checkpoint feedback<br />\n<br />\n- As a part of your checkpoint submission, you must upload your submission to MarvelApp so we can provide direct feedback on your designs.<br />\n- Make sure to include a URL/comment the link to your marvelapp while uploading your submission<br />\n- Make sure all pages have correct flow! Use correct file numbering. (00, 01, 02, 03)</p>\n\n<h3 class='roundLabel'>Round 2</h3>Submit your final designs with all checkpoint feedback implemented.<br />\n<br />\n- As a part of your checkpoint submission, you must upload your submission to MarvelApp so we can provide direct feedback on your designs.<br />\n- Make sure to include a URL/comment the link to your marvelapp while uploading your submission<br />\n- Make sure all pages have correct flow! Use correct file numbering. (00, 01, 02, 03)<br />\n<br />We are looking to design a creative (and useful) data visualization dashboard that will make it easier for our users to see their data and take action with their data. This challenge is focused on designing dashboards for the Tableau platform.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#B22222\"><strong>What is Contingent Staffing?</strong></span><br />\nA contingent workforce is a labor pool whose members are hired by an organization on an on-demand basis. A contingent workforce consists of freelancers, independent contractors, and consultants who are not on the company&#39;s payroll because they are not full-time employees of the organization.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Design Considerations:</strong></span><br />\n- We are looking for modern designs (think FLAT, futuristic).<br />\n- Try not to have too much information on your dashboard, you can make them compelling by making the visualization interactive and enable users to walk through the different insights.<br />\n- Please go through the Tableau guidelines to understand to what extent a design can be implemented in the Tableau.<br />\n- We are providing some sample data, which you can use in your designs.<br />\n- Use color, visual comparison, and drill-down charts to highlight comparison.<br />\n- Have your designs of size: 1366 x 768px (desktop) and 750 x 1334px (mobile)<br />\n<span style=\"color:#FF0000\">- We also want you to show how the dashboard would look like in mobile for 1 or 2 screens.

WebAPI - Implement Scope Module REST APIs","description":"<h3><strong>Challenge Objectives:</strong></h3>\nThis challenge is the initial challenge of this project, and it will create the WebAPIs for the scope validation rules screens.&nbsp;\n\n<h3><strong>Project Background</strong></h3>\nMigrating an existing Workload Modernization Engine&nbsp; ( WAME),&nbsp; from &quot;Microsoft Access based DB application&quot; to &quot; .Net Core Web Application&quot;. WAME web application is design to handle multiple tenants, with each tenant has dedicated DB and Master DB to resolve(identify) tenant. This online application uses ANGULAR as UI and WEB API as middleware and backend DB as SQLServer 2014. Data import and export to WAME will be done using excel files.<br />\n<br />\nTo enable the migration, we need to develop the required &quot;Web API(s)&quot; for the decision engine in series of challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Web API(s) are act as a middleware for data access. Since Web API gets data from/to excel, middleware should be able to handle bulk data read/write with optimized performance. Approximate number of records in excel is about 100,000. File size may be about 1-3MB.\n<p>There are 4 major types of Web API(s)</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Functional API(s):</strong><br />\nAll these APIs has functionality like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Upload (Import) Excel (WRITE data)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>After uploading file(s) from UI, API has to receive binary and create VM/DTO(list).

You need to implement the following APIs.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n1. Export Validation Rule: GET /scope/exportValidationRules</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>This api will select data from the&nbsp;DE_Scope_Validation db table, and export them as an Excel file to download.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>2.&nbsp;Import Scope Validation Rules. POST&nbsp;&nbsp;/scope/importValidationRules - the request must be a multi-part request.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>This api will sync data from the uploaded Excel file into the&nbsp;DE_Scope_Validation table</li>\n\t<li>You need to validate each record, and log the errors in the&nbsp;Log_ImportRulesErrors table. Please trucate the data in&nbsp;Log_ImportRulesErrors table first.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>For each record, you may need to delete, insert or update the corresponding data in the&nbsp;DE_Scope_Validation table</li>\n</ul>\n3.&nbsp;Run the Scope Determination Rule Set:&nbsp;POST&nbsp;&nbsp;/scope/runDeterminationRules\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>It will first execute some sql statements to reset the state data in the database tables.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Then it will load the rules from the&nbsp;DE_Scope_Validation table.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>For each rule, it will construct a dynamic SQL to select the records from one of the CTDB_Location_CMO,&nbsp;CTDB_SERVER_CMO,&nbsp;CTDB_App_CMO, CTDB_DB_CMO and&nbsp;CTDB_ADHOC_CMO tables (with necessary joins).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>For each retrieved CTDB_*_CMO table record, it needs to set its&nbsp;InScopeCalc=&#39;N&#39; and InScopeCalcReason = the-reason-from-rule and save back to the database, and then sync the&nbsp;InScopeCalc and&nbsp;InScopeCalcReason field values to the&nbsp;CTDB_reliability_p table.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n4. View Errors: GET /scope/{type}/errors - type can be importValidationRules, runValidationRules or&nbsp;importOverrides&nbsp;\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>importValidationRules errors - select the error records from&nbsp;Log_ImportRulesErrors table, and export them as an Excel file to download</li>\n\t<li>runValidationRules&nbsp; - it seems there is no error table defined for this.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>importOverrides - select error records from&nbsp;Log_OverrideImport table, and&nbsp;export them as an Excel file to download</li>\n</ul>\n5.&nbsp;Export Scope Review Form: GET /scope/exportReviewForm - with entity=xx parameter, there can be multiple (or none for all).&nbsp;\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The entity can be:&nbsp;Location, Server, App, A2SM, DB, Adhoc, and their corresponding tables are&nbsp;CTDB_Location_CMO,&nbsp;CTDB_SERVER_CMO,&nbsp;CTDB_App_CMO,&nbsp;CTDB_A2SM_CMO,&nbsp;CTDB_DB_CMO and&nbsp;CTDB_ADHOC_CMO.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>If an entity is provided in the request, the api should perform the query against the corresponding table, and create a worksheet in the Excel file to export. The query is already well documented in the&nbsp;DE_SCOPE.docx document.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>If no entities are provided in the request, it&#39;s handled like all entities are provided.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n6.&nbsp;Import Scope Overrides: POST /scope/importOverrides - the request will contain an array of entities (or none for all).&nbsp; It should be a multi-part request.&nbsp;\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The file to be imported has the same format as the file exported from api-5 above.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>The entity can be:&nbsp;Location, Server, App, A2SM, DB, Adhoc as above. You need to ensure the uploaded Excel document has the worksheets corresponding to the provided entities. And only the worksheets of the provided enitites need to be processed, all others will be ignored. If no entities are provided, all worksheets in the uploaded Excel document will be processed.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>For each record in the worksheet, you should perform the operations as described in the&nbsp;DE_SCOPE.docx document. Note that the data should be updated in the corresponding CTDB_*_CMO table with updated&nbsp;InScopeOverride and InScopeOverrideReason field-values. And you should also sync the updated&nbsp;InScopeOverride and InScopeOverrideReason field-values in the&nbsp;CTDB_reliability_p table.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p>xUnit tests are required.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>General Requirements:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Data Modeling</strong></p>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>This project follows DB first approach.

Fix issue with saving the profile traits</span></h3>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Many users encounter issues while saving their basic info.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Some possible causes may be:</span></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Sometimes the API returns 401/403 which may be due to an expired JWT. You need to investigate the current implementation, check if the JWT is not getting refreshed after expiration and fix it.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">The basic_info trait object works as a &ldquo;proxy&rdquo; to the user&rsquo;s basic information and the API creates an object on the fly even if there&rsquo;s no basic_info trait in the database (example </span><a href=\"http://take.ms/7v09L\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-size:11pt\">http://take.ms/7v09L</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">). The issue is that the frontend is not properly identifying if the basic_info trait is a trait that exists in the database or if it was created &ldquo;on the fly&rdquo; thus it&rsquo;s picking the wrong method (POST/PUT) to create/update the actual basic_info trait. You need to identify the root of this issue and fix it. You can experiment by deleting your basic_info trait using POSTMAN (</span><strong>DELETE https://api.topcoder-dev.com/v3/members/{handle}/traits?traitIds=basic_info</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">)</span></p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">If you find any other issue that may cause issues saving/updating the user traits, it needs to be fixed. Your submission must ensure that updating the user information through the settings page is robust and it&rsquo;s not throwing any errors.</span></p>\n\n<h3><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(67, 67, 67); font-family:arial; font-size:14pt\">2. Track selection</span></h3>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The track selection toggles are not working. Clicking a track does nothing. This must be fixed.</span></p>\n\n<h3><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(67, 67, 67); font-family:arial; font-size:14pt\">3. Fix issue with missing styleName</span></h3>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">At times, when a user goes to the settings page (/settings/profile), the page does not load and the error &ldquo;Error: Could not resolve the styleName &lsquo;hide&rsquo;&rdquo; is shown in the console log. You need to check all pages under the settings page and make sure this styleName is not missing anywhere.</span></p>\n\n<h3><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(67, 67, 67); font-family:arial; font-size:14pt\">4.

href=\"https://www.ca.com/us/company/acquisitions/rally-is-now-ca-technologies.html\">Rally ALM</a> (Application lifecycle management - now called CA Agile Central) is a software project management suite that focuses on the Agile delivery of projects. It allows scrum teams to define user stories, test cases, defects and other project artifacts. In order to gain higher levels of developer productivity, it is important that an enterprise&rsquo;s SCM&nbsp; can talk to the project management tool and vice versa.<br />\n<br />\nMore specifically every commit should have a reference to the ALM&rsquo;s story id and vice versa.&nbsp; Our client enforces a commit log format that must include the Rally artifact ID to identify the work item that the changes are committed for. This is a common practice, however, the story in ALM does not have the authors of the commits nor links to the commits themselves.&nbsp; Rally Connector for Bitbucket Server is a server extension that allows Bitbucket to integrate with Rally.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this extension has not been supported in several years and does not work with the current version of Rally since it was purchased by CA. &nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Logo Requirements</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>We are looking for something unique and easy to recognize of Logo Design of Bitbucket Server Extension For Rally ALM application</li>\n\t<li>Your logo design may include Bitbucket and Rally Software logos.

Transaction Predictor DS Sprint - Test Harness Challenge","description":"<br />\n<strong>Challenge Objectives</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Write a script to to generate transactions for the last 30 days in the given dataset in csv format.</li>\n\t<li>Build a command line test harness script to verify the accuracy of the predictions that will be done in the DS challenge.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Project Background</strong><br />\n<br />\nThe client would like to run a single data science sprint to generate a proof of concept which meets a minimum threshold. The input data is a set of financial transactions. From the input data the POC will be focused on predicting three main points of each transaction:\n<ol>\n\t<li>The date of the next transaction</li>\n\t<li>The amount of the next transaction</li>\n\t<li>Each separate transaction if multiple transactions occur to the same entity in a single month</li>\n</ol>\nThe primary goal of each prediction is to be within a margin of error &lt;1.5 days and &lt;15&euro;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Technology Stack</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Python 3.6+</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Individual requirements</strong><br />\n<br />\n<u>Generate Transactions for Last 30 days</u><br />\nWrite a script in python which can filter the transactions for the last 30 days in a given dataset (provided in forums) that can be used for test harness. The filtered transactions can be written as a csv file with the following columns.\n<ul>\n\t<li>Userid</li>\n\t<li>Id</li>\n\t<li>Days</li>\n\t<li>Quantity&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Category</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<u>Test Harness Script</u>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">1. The command line application should open and read a csv file, submissions.csv.&nbsp; The submissions.csv file will have 3 columns:&nbsp; submission id (6 digit Topcoder submission id), output file path, accuracy.&nbsp; The filename should be configurable or passed as a command line parameter.<br />\n2. The application should read the submissions.csv file.&nbsp; For each line in the submission id the application should do the following:</div>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:80px\">2.1 Read the csv output file (predicted transactions) specified by the path. (sample provided in forums)<br />\n2.2 Read the csv which contains our own data, this path should be configurable or passed as a command like parameter.&nbsp; The data will have the same structure as the csv above but this file has the correct &quot;transactions&quot; for next 30 days generated from the dataset.<br />\n2.3 For a given predicted transaction find a matching transaction with day and amount within the acceptable limits of the prediction goal. (The primary goal of each prediction is to be within a margin of error &lt;1.5 days and &lt;15&euro;). The comparison should be done regardless of the order of elements. The accuracy metric is fairly simple: Accuracy = # of accepted transactions / # of total transactions<br />\n2.4 Record the accuracy statistics in the submissions.csv file.&nbsp; Accuracy is measured as the # of correct results / # of total results.<br />\n2.5 Calculate the prediction score based on the Challenge Scoring provided in the forum.</div>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">3. The app should provide summary and progress information to the console screen to verify that execution is proceeding.<br />\n4. Code from a previous Python Test Harness is being provided in the Code Document forum for this challenge.</div>\n<br /><br /><h2>Final Submission Guidelines</h2><ul>\n\t<li>Please submit all code required by the application in your submission.zip</li>\n\t<li>Document the build process for your code including all dependencies (pip installs etc..)</li>\n\t<li>Provide instructions on how to execute your application.</li>\n</ul>\n","descriptionFormat":"HTML","projectId":6781,"created":"2018-11-22T12:11:34Z","createdBy":"cyberjag","updated":"2018-12-04T04:48:05Z","updatedBy":"AutoPilot","timelineTemplateId":"140b24d5-5259-4449-bc1f-3780f3b01555","phases":[{"id":"167a2181-08d1-4a50-9bd7-117de3aa7919","name":"Registration","phaseId":"a93544bc-c165-4af4-b55e-18f3593b457a","duration":864000,"scheduledStartDate":"2018-11-22T14:04:39Z","scheduledEndDate":"2018-12-02T14:06:51Z","actualStartDate":"2018-11-22T14:04:39Z","actualEndDate":"2018-12-02T14:06:51Z","isOpen":false},{"id":"0d8a3952-3ba3-4f84-8782-79e8fa4da410","name":"Iterative

Sonic Branding Audio Design Competition","description":"Welcome to the Topcoder Sonic Branding Audio Design Competition. Many of the world&rsquo;s most iconic brands have a memorable &lsquo;Sonic Logo&rsquo; or &lsquo;Sonic Branding&rsquo;. Sonic Logos are the short audio sound-bites consumers associate with a brand. They are often paired with a &lsquo;logo reveal&rsquo; and are used at the ends of commercials, in social videos, or at the loading screen of an application.<br />\n<br />\nIf you&rsquo;ve ever seen an LG, Samsung, or Intel commercial or ever started a movie on Netflix, then you have experienced a Sonic Logo.<br />\n<br />\nThis is a different challenge than we usually run at Topcoder. We&#39;re looking for members that have some audio skills and are up for trying something new. Jump in and give it a try!!\n<h3 class='roundLabel'>Round 1</h3>Initial sonic logo ideas and submissions\n<h3 class='roundLabel'>Round 2</h3>Refined sonic logo submissions based on the checkpoint feedback and additional&nbsp;direction<br /><strong>What do Sonic Logos contain?</strong><br />\nMost sonic logos are just notes of some sort, paired together in a memorable way.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Here are some famous examples:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>LG - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7Ajix6rWSY&amp;list=PL4C8E950814120411&amp;index=3\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7Ajix6rWSY&amp;list=PL4C8E950814120411&amp;index=3</a></li>\n\t<li>Sony and Intel - (back to back in this video) - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3QT543xVzg&amp;list=PL4C8E950814120411&amp;index=4\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3QT543xVzg&amp;list=PL4C8E950814120411&amp;index=4</a></li>\n\t<li>T-Mobile - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPB-2RwqH0U&amp;index=8&amp;list=PL4C8E950814120411\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPB-2RwqH0U&amp;index=8&amp;list=PL4C8E950814120411</a></li>\n\t<li>XBox - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjT2hAydPnk&amp;list=PL4C8E950814120411&amp;index=12\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjT2hAydPnk&amp;list=PL4C8E950814120411&amp;index=12</a></li>\n</ul>\n<br />\nSome sonic logos will incorporate the name of the brand or a small lyric jingle to accompany the notes. While we aren&rsquo;t looking for lyrics in our Sonic Logo, it is good to understand the variety that exists. Here is a famous example: McDonald&rsquo;s - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBlD2N_AwgI\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBlD2N_AwgI</a><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Characteristics of a successful sonic logo:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>They are very concise typically, 2 to 6 seconds</li>\n\t<li>They often use memorable, familiar tones</li>\n\t<li>They can feature heavy syncopation&nbsp;\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Syncopation Definition - placement of rhythmic stresses or accents where they wouldn&#39;t normally occur creating a sense of surprise</li>\n\t\t<li>Syncopation Video - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9QnepxnMNU\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9QnepxnMNU</a></li>\n\t\t<li>T-Mobile link above is a good example of syncopation</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>They often use higher register notes (think of notes played up &lsquo;high&rsquo; on the piano towards the right hand side of the instrument)</li>\n\t<li>They can be dramatic or &lsquo;sweeping&rsquo; - Intel and XBox are good examples of &lsquo;dramatic&rsquo; sonic logos</li>\n\t<li>They are memorable !!!</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\nWhen you create your submissions for this challenge we encourage you to experiment! This is a competition where you can let your creative juices flow and submit multiple times if you care to!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Here is the animated Topcoder logo you&rsquo;ll be creating a sonic logo for:</strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=14dKvdL0jVNpl1AAp8Fk8sOQGJCoQFZT9\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=14dKvdL0jVNpl1AAp8Fk8sOQGJCoQFZT9</a><br />\n<br />\nWe encourage you to think deeply about the Topcoder brand and what matters to us.\n<ul>\n\t<li>We are a global community</li>\n\t<li>We solve big problems</li>\n\t<li>We use bright colors, with an artful mix of primary and secondary colors (how can those colors translate into sounds - well that is your job here!)&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>We are in technology and often are selling to technology companies</li>\n\t<li>We help companies and entrepreneurs &lsquo;take flight&rsquo; and go from idea to real solutions!&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>We are bold and groundbreaking</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>We are not looking for you to add sound effects to the animated logo. Think musically, not sound designing the animation itself.</strong><br />\n<br />\nTake that inspiration and put it into your Topcoder sonic logo! You are not required and will not be judged on any paired animation of our logo with the audio Sonic Logo. If you feel pairing your audio submission with an animation helps to enhance your submission, then please feel free to submit an animation.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Notes:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>You must use your own work.</li>\n\t<li>You can, of course, be inspired by other brands, but the concept and execution of the audio concept must be wholly original.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Submission Guidelines:</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Please submit your files in .wav or .mp3</li>\n\t<li>If you want to showcase a demo of the Sonic Logo to a paired animation, please submit in a .mp4 file</li>\n\t<li>Again, the paired animation is NOT required.</li>\n</ul>\n","descriptionFormat":"HTML","projectId":23403,"created":"2018-11-21T01:41:02Z","createdBy":"tgerring","updated":"2019-01-03T01:17:18Z","updatedBy":"tgerring","timelineTemplateId":"4a59472b-0743-4dae-9739-1f5b327e1255","phases":[{"duration":172800,"scheduledEndDate":"2018-11-21T03:05:54Z","actualEndDate":"2018-11-21T03:05:54Z","isOpen":false,"name":"Specification
