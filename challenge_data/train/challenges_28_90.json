It&#39;s a classic case of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality\">curse of dimensionality</a>.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nWe&#39;d like to take a step back from our current prediction model and see if we can create a set of curve attribute grouping rules that we can apply to the LNAM assignments.&nbsp; This rule generation process itself will still require some training but it takes its inspiration from the methodology that the human experts use:&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nHere&#39;s the process that we need to introduce into our app:&nbsp;<br />\n1.&nbsp; In our training set we need to group our LAS files by LNAM.<br />\n2.&nbsp; We should then accumulate a list of all possible curve attributes for each LNAM group.<br />\n3.&nbsp; The application should identify the list of the common curve attributes across each LNAM class.&nbsp; The goal is to identify not only the curve attributes that LNAM class share but also the curve attributes that make one LNAM class distinct from another.<br />\n4.&nbsp; Curves attributes are also related to vendor.&nbsp; Each logging operator has a set of tools that they operate.&nbsp; Some of the logging tools have common names but some are distinct by vendor.&nbsp; We have some documents that map curve attributes (tools) to vendors.&nbsp; The logging operators are designated in the LAS files by the SRVC element. &nbsp;&nbsp;Vendor documents are attached in a zip file in the Code Document section of the forums.&nbsp; The &ldquo;mnemonic&rdquo; and &ldquo;Company&rdquo; columns are the ones that are relevant to this challenge.<br />\n5.&nbsp; Assign the LNAM based on the curves (and if necessary) the logging operator (SRVC).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nOur current app has several features that are useful:<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n1.&nbsp; It parses and loads a set of LAS file attributes into a pandas dataframe.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n2.&nbsp; It cleans and normalizes the LAS files in preparation for transformation to pandas. The app generates a cleaned copy of the data into a new folder.<br />\n3.&nbsp; It produces a testing.csv which extracts the LNAM attribute from a directory of LAS files.<br />\n4.&nbsp; It can compare the output of the prediction process (e.g., prediction.csv) to the testing.csv (the ground truth) and generate an accuracy score.&nbsp; The process can also generate more detailed classification reports by LNAM.<br />\n5.&nbsp; Curve attributes are One Hot Encoded in the dataframe.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\nPlease revise the current application with some new command line arguments which align with the process outlined above:&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n1.&nbsp; aggregate-curves (Steps #1-2) above.&nbsp; I think it would be helpful to write this information to a &quot;curves&quot; directory with each curve&#39;s parameters listed in its own file.&nbsp; Ultimately, this app will be processing large numbers of files.<br />\n2.&nbsp; process-curves (Steps #3 above).&nbsp; This step should generate the curve parameters in memory but also produce an xlsx report of the n most common LNAM&#39;s.&nbsp; The n -- the number of LNAM&#39;s -- should be configurable.&nbsp; The report should also list the absolute number and relative frequency of the LNAM&#39;s in the data set.<br />\n3.&nbsp; curve-predict (Steps #4 and 5) above.&nbsp; We have a set of metadata that we produce as final output of our prediction process.&nbsp; The app should use the curve and vendor info to make a prediction about the LNAM and generate the requested prediction output in csv form.&nbsp; The current app produces output with the following columns:&nbsp; File Name,UWI,LNAM,Service Company,Log Type,Cased Holed Flag,Generic Toolstring.&nbsp; The logic to generate Log Type,Cased Holed Flag, and Generic Toolstring fields are already present in the app.&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nCouple of additional issues to resolve/consider:&nbsp;<br />\n1.&nbsp; The current app seems to undercount at least one (and maybe more) of curve attributes.&nbsp; For example, the curve attribute &ldquo;CCL&rdquo; is underrepresented in a recent review of the values_count() output from the dataframe compared with a grep count in the target directory containing the LAS files.&nbsp; Please validate that all the curve parameters/attributes are being recorded in our initial dataframe and output reports and are resolving properly in our prediction logic. &nbsp;&nbsp;I think there could be an issue with the app&rsquo;s One Hot Encoding logic.<br />\n2.&nbsp; We&#39;ve tried some things like truncating the curve attribute names to reduce the number of inputs. So far it hasn&#39;t helped predictive ability much using the initial Random Forest but you&#39;re welcome to experiment with various simplification schemes.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Evaluation Criteria</strong><br />\nIn addition, to good coding style and accomplishing the tasks set out above, 30% of score will be ranked assessment of your LNAM predictions against our ground truth data.&nbsp; The submission with the highest score in this scorecard element will receive a 10, next a 9 and so on.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nYou are welcome/encouraged to use your creativity to increase the predictive ability of your solution.&nbsp;

Each test case in is given with a series of steps and expected results and it&rsquo;s required to split it into smaller test scenarios. Cucumber (Gherkin) is used to specify the tests in our code base so you will need to convert the test steps into Cucumber scenarios. Use Page Objects, Backgrounds and Scenario Outlines wisely. Parametrize the steps and reuse existing steps wherever possible. SpecFlow has an extension for VisualStudio that will make it easier to develop and run the tests. Also, take a look at the documentation page at </span><a href=\"https://specflow.org/docs/\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">https://specflow.org/docs/</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\"> </span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">NOTE: To minimize duplicate code and merge conflicts, we have made some test cases dependent on others - that means that once the parent test case is implemented and merged we will open the dependent ones for pickup. For example: there are test cases to create an entity with different user roles and test cases for all other CRUD actions for that same entity - only one test case is available in the beginning (create entity as user X) and the remaining related cases are opened once the first one is implemented.</span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Base code already contains implementation of scenarios for the first test case (US_1.1.1_TC01) - use the implementation as a model on how to convert the test cases to actual Cucumber scenarios. All the test cases defined in this project have similar structure and test for more than one thing in a test case - that&rsquo;s why we want a test case to be split into multiple scenarios that each test only one thing. Test scenarios with multiple Given -&gt; Then -&gt; And -&gt; Given sections should be avoided so we don&rsquo;t end up with spaghetti code. For example, the demo test case has been split into </span><a href=\"https://gitlab.com/abb-testing/rcs-testing/blob/develop/RCS.Tests/Features/Roles.feature\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">multiple scenarios</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">:</span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Verifying the default roles are displayed</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Verifying the form fields are displayed in create role form</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Verifying the tabs contain the correct fields</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Test for back button behavior</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Test for creating a role</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Etc</span></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">In a nutshell each test scenario should do a series of actions, and verify the results (verifying more than one thing is ok), but we should avoid scenarios that perform user actions, verify something, perform more actions, verify more results etc - split such scenarios where possible.</span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>How To Participate</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Register for the challenge. </span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Step 1 - Create a Gitlab Account if you do not have one already</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Step 2 - Use the self-registration link and register yourself to get the gitlab project access - SEE CHALLENGE FORUMS FOR THE LINK</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Step 3 - Then access the GitLab tickets here - </span><a href=\"https://gitlab.com/abb-testing/rcs-testing/issues\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-size:11pt\">https://gitlab.com/abb-testing/rcs-testing/issues</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\"> </span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Step 4 - Choose the ticket labeled as &quot;tcx_OpenForPickup&quot; and assign yourself to the ticket</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Step 5 - Remove the &quot;tcx_OpenForPickup&quot; label and add &quot;tcx_Assigned&quot;.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Step 6 - Work on the chosen ticket and submit your automated test case by creating a new branch for the ticket. </span><strong>Please make sure to name each branch as &ldquo;issueX&rdquo;</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\"> where X is the issue ID in Gitlab.

color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Summarization refers to the task of producing a shortened version of a document that contains the document&rsquo;s key points. The need for automated document summarization arises from abundance of text data and lack of sufficient resources for manual review. </span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">In this competition, you will be provided a dataset of news articles and corresponding summaries. Using this dataset, you are asked to develop a model that can produce summaries that capture the key points of a given input text.</span></p>\n\n<h2><strong>Input files</strong></h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">We are using a public dataset in this challenge. The full dataset consists of approximately 312,085 online news articles (CNN and Daily Mail) and corresponding summaries. On average, the articles are 781 tokens in length and the summaries are 56 tokens in length.

Material Supply Plant - Tableau DViz Design Concepts Challenge","description":"Welcome to <strong>&quot;Tsunami&rsquo;s Material Supply Plant - Tableau DViz Design Concepts Challenge&quot;</strong>. In this challenge, explore design concepts for a new Data Visualization Dashboard that will be implemented on the Tableau platform.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe main goal is to design dashboards for the materials management team within the Tsunami&rsquo;s manufacturing facilities. These individuals need visibility into raw materials and parts required to assemble their finished goods. We are developing separate dashboards for 2 personas (The Material Planner and Materials Manager/Lead), both are interdependent on one another. Keep in mind these personas are only responsible for inventories needed to manufacture products; finished goods production is out-of-scope.<br />\n<br />\nWe recommend you to start by digging into data visualization design best practices. Research and think about simple ways to provide data visualization experiences.<br />\n<br />\nWe are really excited to kick off this new DViz Design Concepts Challenge.\n<h3 class='roundLabel'>Round 1</h3>Submit your initial designs for a checkpoint feedback<br />\n<br />\n- As a part of your checkpoint submission, you must upload your submission to MarvelApp so we can provide direct feedback on your designs.<br />\n- Make sure to include a URL/comment the link to your marvelapp while uploading your submission<br />\n- Make sure all pages have the correct flow! Use correct file numbering. (00, 01, 02, 03)\n<h3 class='roundLabel'>Round 2</h3>Submit your final designs with all checkpoint feedback implemented.<br />\n<br />\n- As a part of your checkpoint submission, you must upload your submission to MarvelApp so we can provide direct feedback on your designs.<br />\n- Make sure to include a URL/comment the link to your marvelapp while uploading your submission<br />\n- Make sure all pages have the correct flow! Use correct file numbering. (00, 01, 02, 03)<br /><div>We are looking to design creative (and useful) data visualization dashboard that will make it easier for customers to see their data and take action with their data. This challenge is focused on designing dashboards for the Tableau platform.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Design Considerations</strong></span><br />\n- We are looking for a simple, easy-to-use, informative, modern design.<br />\n- Try not to have too much information on your dashboard, you can make them compelling by making the visualization interactive and enable users to walk through or drill into the different insights.<br />\n- Please go through the Tableau guidelines to understand to what extent a design can be implemented in the Tableau.<br />\n- We are provided some sample data (please see forums), which you can use in your designs.<br />\n- Use color, visual comparison, and drill-down charts to highlight comparison.<br />\n- Have your designs of size: 1366 x 768px<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Required Dashboard Designs</strong></span><br />\n<strong>01 General Dashboard Features:</strong><br />\nBelow aspects are a common theme in all reports, please make sure it is incorporated...<br />\n- Overall think through the provided requirements for the dashboards and come up with meaningful designs for the dashboards.<br />\n- Need to think on how to layout out the filters<br />\n- Take a look at the features of tableau/look to incorporate features that you think would be useful.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#B22222\"><strong>A. Material Planner - Brad</strong></span><br />\n<strong>01 Single Plant View</strong><br />\n- The parts supply in the plant comes from multiple distributors.&nbsp; The plant is located in Gary, Indiana.&nbsp; (Please see the reference image and excel file to get better understanding)<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Parameters</strong><br />\n- <strong>Starting Balance</strong>: this is the inventory on hand<br />\n- <strong>Daily Demands Quantity</strong>: this is the amount of parts that is needed for each day<br />\n- <strong>Delivery Quantity</strong>: this is the amount that is delivered or will be delivered, to replenish the inventory to continue meeting the Daily Demands.&nbsp; Some deliveries from local distributors come in daily or once or twice a week.&nbsp; Other deliveries across the country don&rsquo;t come in as often.&nbsp; If it is an international delivery it can take weeks.<br />\n- <strong>Shortage</strong>: this is how many parts short the plant is, based on the daily demand and the current inventory<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Green &amp; Red views: </strong><br />\nGreen means everything is on track and on schedule. Red means that there is a warning for a gap or potential gap.<br />\n- It is important that the Starting Balance on each of the parts in the plant meets the Daily Demands.&nbsp; If it is not, there should be a red indicator.&nbsp; The Starting Balance is dependent on deliveries, so if a delivery is delayed it will show up in the dashboard, and while the plant may be able to meet the Daily Demands in the short term, this may affect the numbers in the long term.&nbsp; As the days go on and the Daily Demand is not met, the Shortage number will continue to increase.&nbsp; Like a domino effect, one day affects the other<br />\n- Brad is most concerned with what&rsquo;s going on within a 10 day time span.&nbsp; So even though he can see what&rsquo;s going on further out, he is most concerned with that 10 day window.&nbsp; For each of those days in his view, he can see the parameters listed above.<br />\n- If there is a delay in the delivery schedule, it could affect fulfilling those Daily Demands if there is not enough in the current inventory.&nbsp; You need to show how this will affect the Starting Balance for each day.&nbsp; So while it may not affect meeting the demands in the near future, because there is enough in the current inventory, eventually that inventory will run out and this needs to be reflected in the dashboard.&nbsp; &nbsp;As mentioned, a red indicator would be used for those days the demand will not be met.<br />\n- In addition to changes in the delivery schedule, there can also be changes in the Daily Demand needs.&nbsp; So if this number increases, it is possible that the plant will not be able to meet future demands, depending on the inventory and delivery schedule.&nbsp; There would be a red indicator showing when this would be a problem.<br />\n- Brad should be able to manually make changes to the Daily Demand, but remember this could have an affect down the line based on future Daily Demands and the Delivery Schedule.<br />\n- Keep in mind that all of these parameters have an effect on the other parameters.&nbsp; There is a constant push and pull.&nbsp; If the delivery is delayed, that affects future inventory and increases the Shortage.&nbsp; If Demand increases, that also could affect inventory and Shortages.&nbsp; There could even be cases where both the delivery is delayed and there is an increase in Demand which would be even more critical.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Mapping System</strong><br />\n- The dashboard should also be able to support a mapping system showing the delivery schedules.<br />\n- Tsunami receives deliveries both locally, nationally, and internationally.&nbsp; Parts are delivered by trucks, planes, boats, and trains.<br />\n- The main methods of delivery is by truck.&nbsp; But there are situations where deliveries from other countries come in by boat, and then the container is loaded onto a train, and finally reaches the Indiana plant by truck.&nbsp; Try and capture this and various other situations on a map.&nbsp; Show the different points in the delivery, like clearing customs, loading and unloading, and possible delays.<br />\n- Local/Domestic sourced parts come in 1 or 2 days a week<br />\n- International suppliers of parts are mainly located in Mexico, China, Canada, and Germany<br />\n- The mapping system should provide predictive visual alerting to show risks to delivery schedules, which will cause a shortage, based on weather, natural disasters, traffic delays, or other news events impacting transportation of inbound freight.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Filters</strong><br />\n- Time span for dashboard views and filtering.&nbsp; As mentioned, Brad is most concerned with seeing within a 10 day window, but he still needs to see further out.<br />\n- 10 days is most critical<br />\n- 30 days<br />\n- 12 week view is the maximum<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Total Roll-Up View</strong><br />\n- Even though Brad is only concerned with his plant, we would also like to see a view showing an overview of all 15 plants across the United States.&nbsp; Parts are mostly unique to each manufacturing plant, although a few parts are shared.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#B22222\"><strong>B. Materials Manager/Lead - Brittany</strong></span><br />\n- Every month Brittany does her inventory accounting work by looking over the quantity and costs associated with parts inventory at her plant.&nbsp; This gives her the financial outlook for the month going forward.&nbsp; Her job is to forecast the plant&rsquo;s Profit Plan monthly.&nbsp; She is only concerned with her plant in Gary, Indiana.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThese are the buckets and indicators that she needs to see on her dashboard to create her monthly Profit Plan.&nbsp; She needs to be able to input the money spent on each of these categories to calculate her Profit Plan forecast. Brittany needs to outlook her plan for the next 12 months. (Please reference the example provided)<br />\n- <strong>Component Parts</strong>: units that are made up from Raw parts<br />\n- <strong>Raw Inventory</strong>: parts used for building units and appliances (screws, valves, steel, etc)<br />\n- <strong>WIP Inventory</strong>: partially finished goods waiting for completion and eventual sale or the value of these items.<br />\n- <strong>Service Parts (Unique)</strong>: an interchangeable part that is kept in an inventory and used for the repair or replacement of failed units.<br />\n- <strong>Launches</strong>: parts needed to fill the demand for new appliances being released<br />\n- <strong>Freight in Inventory Adjustment:</strong> the freight costs associated with parts inventory on-hand<br />\n- <strong>Obsolescence</strong>: Pertains to launches.&nbsp; Parts she holds for x-amount of years as reserves, until the finished good is no longer being manufactured, or the part can be scrapped<br />\n- <strong>MRO/Non Product</strong>: Products that are used and needed for everyday maintenance on the plant.&nbsp; And to maintain day to day operations of the facility<br />\n<br />\nFor a more detailed description of these terms. Please see the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TprLPa85stH4vG-mFsbSnMdjVWJ0ImcvKEKJ9MYUhWc/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">Glossary of Categories</a><br />\n<br />\nShe should be able to manually make adjustments to each of the categories.&nbsp; When these categories are calculated, she can get a forecast of the Raw WIP Profit Plan, but she can also see what the Actual Profit Plan numbers turned out to be, as the months go on and compare them to her predictions.<br />\n- Historical Actuals on Raw WIP is also used to predict the end of month numbers.&nbsp; Brittany uses this to see if she is in the ballpark with her forecasts.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Total Roll-Up View</strong><br />\nEven though Brittany is only concerned with her plant in Gary, Indiana.&nbsp; She would also like to see an overview of these particular buckets across all 15 North America plants:<br />\n- Component Parts<br />\n- Raw Inventory<br />\n- WIP Inventory<br />\n- Service Parts (Unique)<br />\n- MRO/ Non Prod<br />\n- Launches<br />\n- Freight in Inventory Adjustment<br />\n<br />\nShe would also like to see a monthly, quarterly, and yearly view, with prior year comparison. Forecasts are built on an annual basis but adjusted quarterly &amp; monthly.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong>References</strong></span><br />\nExample dashboards designs that were published in the tableau<br />\n- <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/gallery\" target=\"_blank\">https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/gallery</a><br />\n- <a href=\"https://www.tableau.com/learn/webinars/design-tricks-great-dashboards\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.tableau.com/learn/webinars/design-tricks-great-dashboards</a><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Important:</strong></span><br />\n- Keep things consistent.

We are not looking for new concepts and directions for this challenge<br />\n- The WOW Factor in your design creation!<br />\n<br />\n<u><span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Challenge Forum</strong></span></u><br />\nIf you have any doubts or questions regarding challenge requirements, please ask in our challenge forum:<br />\n<a href=\"https://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=ThreadList&amp;forumID=671130\">https://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=ThreadList&amp;forumID=671130 </a><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><u><strong>Screen Requirements</strong></u></span><br />\n<strong>01) EDS Reference Architecture Design</strong><br />\n- Open &quot;<em>EDS Reference Architecture_V1.pptx</em>&quot; and see the First (1st) slide in this document, we need you to create a better design for this architecture diagram in the 1st slide. Slide 2 to 4 is a breakdown of the 1st slide for your reference to help you see the diagram elements more clearly. We only need the first slide to be designed.&nbsp;<br />\n- Each element in your design creation needs to be able to editable. Icons, background, text, etc need to have separated layers so we can easily arrange it for future purpose. Make sure things are labeled appropriately and elements are consistent in your design<br />\n- We need to create the diagram into two different formats - Printing and Presentation purpose:<br />\n-- Printing: A1 Poster size<br />\n-- Presentation: Powerpoint slide size<br />\n- For consideration, Printing and Presentation are one of the cases where this diagram design will be used. We probably will use this design in many other use cases<br />\n- Your design needs to be stand out so people will be excited and able to see it from a distance<br />\n- Your design should be engaging and visually appealing, but also easy to read<br />\n- Make sure you have good use of whitespace<br />\n- Use a grid structure to make sure your design elements remain aligned, organized and cohesive across the diagram<br />\n- Your design should create visual interest for anyone that sees it<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong>Important:</strong><br />\n- Keep things consistent. This means all graphics styles should work together.<br />\n- All of the graphics should have a similar feel and general aesthetic appearance</span><br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<u><span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Branding Guidelines</strong></span></u><br />\n- Follow Our Branding Guidelines Document for Font and Colors<br />\n- Style is up to Designers<br />\n<br />\n<u><span

- Forecasting - Tech Stack Ideation Challenge","description":"<h2>Challenge Overview</h2>\nAn imaginary telecommunications provider aims to improve their five-year forecasting.&nbsp; We have posted an Ideation challenge to explore possible approaches to that task.&nbsp; In this challenge, we seek ideas for technology stacks that are ideal for applications of this kind.<br />\n<br />\nPlease see the <a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/30087695/?type=develop\">URL</a> for details on the solution Ideation challenge.<br />\n<br />\nContestants may submit multiple solutions.&nbsp; To include multiple solutions, package each in a zip file, bundle them in a single zip file, and submit the single zip file.\n<h2>Background</h2>\nPlease read the background section for the Solution ideation linked above.&nbsp; In this challenge, we seek descriptions and examples of tech stacks that solve the problem nicely.\n\n<h2>Challenge Details</h2>\nSuppose an ideal multi-variate model is created that effectively forecasts actual subscription behavior, validated on historical data.&nbsp; The results of this model would be displayed on a dashboard.&nbsp; In addition, users would be able to create what-if scenarios and change the input parameters of the model through the dashboard (or generally, the UI).&nbsp; The tool would be used by statisticians, financial employees, and executives.<br />\n<br />\nYour challenge: recommend a tech stack that provides an excellent solution to this need.&nbsp; Priority should be given to:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Agility: the model will change quarterly</li>\n\t<li>Usability: users will have little time and seek explanable forecasts</li>\n\t<li>Feasibility: highly unusual or very rare solutions are permitted but will not be considered competitive, excepting highly unusual circumstances</li>\n\t<li>Maintenance: is it easy to deploy and use this solution?&nbsp; Will it be relatively easy for resourceful non-programmers to update the visualizations?</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\nThe following technologies are commonly supported but others are also permitted:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Pivotal Cloud Foundry</li>\n\t<li>Python</li>\n\t<li>Qlik</li>\n\t<li>Aviso</li>\n\t<li>Power BI</li>\n\t<li>Tableau&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Java</li>\n\t<li>Open source solutions to this problem</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\nWe

Validation is a priority and will be performed against historical data.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThrough what-if scenarios, the validated model would be used to forecast performance for the next year and each of four additional years that follow.&nbsp; The model would focus on the UK+EU markets and be sensitive to GDP, household income, increases and decreases in addressable markets - or any/all the major factors that typically impact buyer choice.&nbsp; The model should focus on the consumer market.<br />\n<br />\nGiven 5 years of annual &ldquo;actuals&rdquo; for broadband and 5 years of quarterly &ldquo;actuals&rdquo; for mobile, what analytic techniques should be used to create such a model? We are interested in both novel techniques and effective ones that are described in the literature.<br />\n<br />\nYour task in this challenge is to provide a briefing paper that describes an approach to the problem.&nbsp; Your paper should include references in order to support your approach or to provide references to existing approaches.&nbsp; Extra consideration will be given to submissions that include POC implementations of the concept.<br />\n<br />\nContestants may submit multiple solutions.&nbsp; To include multiple solutions, package each in a zip file, bundle them in a single zip file, and submit the single zip file.\n<h2>Background</h2>\nTelecom providers sell products such as broadband and mobile phone contracts. These contracts sell products of different types and capabilities, which are outlined below:\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Mobile\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Handset</li>\n\t\t<li>SIM-only</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Broadband\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Copper</li>\n\t\t<li>Superfast</li>\n\t\t<li>Ultrafast</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\nFor each of the five products the customer would like to forecast the following:\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Volume</li>\n\t<li>Net adds / churn - The number of new subscribers, or gross adds, minus the number of customers that drop service, which is called churn</li>\n\t<li>ARPU - Average Revenue Per User&nbsp;(if possible using industry standards)</li>\n</ul>\nOur model would eventually need to account for:\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Different subscription lengths</li>\n\t<li>Shocks introduced by competitors, eg price disruption and seasonal releases of new product lines (eg Samsung in Spring, Apple in the Fall).</li>\n</ul>\nAn ideal, complete vision for this application would allow:\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Forecasts that are within 20% of eventual actual results for the following year</li>\n\t<li>What-if scenario building by users</li>\n\t<li>Ability to load new datasets in order to test them for relevance against the validated forecast (eg improves accuracy)</li>\n</ul>\nWe will provide a list of the potential input variables in the challenge forum.\n\n<h2>Submission Requirements</h2>\nYour submission should include a text, .doc, PPT or PDF document that includes the following sections and descriptions\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Overview</strong>: describe your approach in &ldquo;laymen&rsquo;s terms&rdquo;</li>\n\t<li><strong>Methods</strong>: describe what you did to come up with this approach, eg literature search, experimental testing, etc</li>\n\t<li><strong>Materials</strong>: did your approach use a specific technology?&nbsp; Any libraries?&nbsp; List all tools and libraries you used</li>\n\t<li><strong>Discussion</strong>: Explain what you attempted, considered or reviewed that worked, and especially those that didn&rsquo;t work or that you rejected.&nbsp; For any that didn&rsquo;t work, or were rejected, briefly include your explanation for the reasons (e.g. such-and-such needs more data than we have).&nbsp; If you are pointing to somebody else&rsquo;s work (eg you&rsquo;re citing a well known implementation or literature), describe in detail how that work relates to this work, and what would have to be modified</li>\n\t<li><strong>Data</strong>:&nbsp; What other data should one consider?&nbsp; Is it in the public domain?&nbsp; Is it derived?&nbsp; Is it necessary in order to achieve the aims?&nbsp; Also, what about the data described/provided - is it enough?</li>\n\t<li><strong>Assumptions and Risks</strong>: what are the main risks of this approach, and what are the assumptions you/the model is/are making?&nbsp; What are the pitfalls of the data set and approach?</li>\n\t<li><strong>Results</strong>: Did you implement your approach?&nbsp; How&rsquo;d it perform?&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re not providing an implementation, use this section to explain the EXPECTED results.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Other</strong>: Discuss any other issues or attributes that don&rsquo;t fit neatly above that you&rsquo;d also like to include.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Proof of Concept</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Extra consideration given to PoC code in Python and Jupyter Notebook (or anything else, so long as we can run it without a license) to illustrate particular approaches / solutions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Judging Criteria</h2>\nWe provide for 5 awards.&nbsp; One first-place award is guaranteed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\nThese submissions will be evaluated subjectively by the client based on the following criteria:\n<ol>\n\t<li>Completeness and Effectiveness (50%)\n\t<ol>\n\t\t<li>Did you complete the sections as required above</li>\n\t\t<li>What&#39;re the key insights we can get from your analysis?</li>\n\t\t<li>How will these discovered insights benefit the client?</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Feasibility (50%)\n\t<ol>\n\t\t<li>Does your submission include enough detail for us to understand if this approach is feasible?</li>\n\t\t<li>Is your solution more likely feasible than other submissions to the challenge?</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Proof of concept <strong>(PoC) solutions</strong> are <strong>appreciated</strong> and will be weighed over otherwise similar submissions.</li>\n</ol>\n<br

Website Style Concept Design Challenge","description":"<strong>Welcome to the Topcoder Website Style Concept Design Challenge!</strong><br />\nWe want to build a new exciting visual style package for Topcoder community public websites. The styles should reflect the renewed energy on updating the Topcoder community and strengthen the Topcoder Community brand.<br />\n<br />\nChallenge Objective:<br />\n- Web design<br />\n- 3 screens<br />\n- Desktop format<br />\n<br />\n<em>Read the challenge specification carefully and let us know if you have any questions.</em>\n<h3 class='roundLabel'>Round 1</h3><strong>Submit your initial design for a Checkpoint Feedback</strong><br />\n- Homepage<br />\n- Track Details<br />\n- Track Details &ndash; Data Set\n<h3 class='roundLabel'>Round 2</h3><strong>Submit your Final Design plus Checkpoint Updates</strong><br />\n- Homepage<br />\n- Track Details<br />\n- Track Details &ndash; Data Set<br /><strong>Background Overview</strong><br />\nExplore and build a visual package for Topcoder Community key pages. Focus on novel visual treatment, avoid replicating well established trends (from websites like Dribbble), and create a high-quality design system and package for several key pages and content modules.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Target audience and domain specifics</strong><br />\nYour visual design concepts should take into account our definition of target audience and geographics. Research and think on what are the drivers/motivators to achieve credibility, visual interest, and brand positioning. We want to not only have a better design from our competitors, but to position ourselves as a great consumer experience, and a professional space.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Target Audience:</strong><br />\n<strong>Students &amp; young professionals. </strong>Tech-savvy people age 16-25 who are starting or fresh out of school, looking to build professional experience as a stepping stone towards their career in the software industry.<br />\n<strong>Freedom-seekers.</strong> Tech-savvy people age 26-35 who want to control when and how they work and earn.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Geographics</strong>: Global<br />\n<br />\n<strong>What is the target audience?</strong><br />\nSmart, innovative, young, independent, competitive, a bit nerdy<br />\n<br />\n<strong>What is our community?</strong><br />\nDiverse, competitive, cooperative, social<br />\n<br />\n<strong>What is the product?</strong><br />\nTrustworthy, intuitive, engaging, motivating, social<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Visual direction</strong><br />\nYour designs must be based on the visual directions we have established. Do not simply copy elements from our moodboard, but creatively transform the style elements. Try to use elements from both directions as they work well together. Use the following moodboard for design inspiration, it does capture our comments and provides a solid direction for your concept explorations: <a href=\"https://marvelapp.com/b63h394/screen/54598285\">https://marvelapp.com/b63h394/screen/54598285</a><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Direction 1: Evolution</strong><br />\nKeyword characteristics: Change, High contrast, Overlay, Fine lines, Scientific<br />\n<br />\nTopcoder started while ago&mdash;18 years to be precise&mdash;and during our journey we did change a lot. This direction outlines our transformation from a website for fun competitive challenges into a professional work platform where people compete to design and build high quality software.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Direction 2: Independence</strong><br />\nKeyword characteristics: Duality, Pattern, Close up, Timeline<br />\n<br />\nWe encourage you to use a combination of both styles as there are elements to be used from both, but this is not mandatory.<br />\n<br />\nFrom a place for fun Topcoder transformed into an alternative type of employment opportunity or side income. This is one of our goals - to help democratize software development and allow people to be in control of what they work on, when they work, where they work, and how much they work. Topcoder is the perfect platform for the freedom-seekers to break from the mundane 9 to 5 job.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Content &amp; Structure</strong><br />\nYou will build a design system that showcases 3 different pages with specific content modules. Our new website will have a redesigned navigation that you should include in your concept designs. Here is the updated navigation specification <a href=\"https://marvelapp.com/89423f8/screen/54465717\">https://marvelapp.com/89423f8/screen/54465717</a> (<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UVp4XANK92LCr2Gp4ZkNWOjXc2romquS\">link to source</a>).<br />\nTo experience the mechanisms of the navigation, check this prototype <a href=\"https://marvelapp.com/f9b88ee/screen/50064026\">https://marvelapp.com/f9b88ee/screen/50064026</a> (but ignore the visual styles!!!).<br />\n<br />\nFor this challenge, we don&rsquo;t have a predefined styleguide&nbsp; or components, and we are looking at it as an exploration challenge to get new ideas for our future style. The only thing we&rsquo;d like you to use is the navigation we attached. Note: the navigation source files are in sketch but you can take a screenshot from Marvel and use in your design.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>1. Home page</strong><br />\nThe home page should be telling the story of what is the Topcoder community, and what people can do. The main page must allow people to quickly identify:<br />\n- What is Topcoder<br />\n- What can I do<br />\n- Where should I go next<br />\n<br />\nThink about how your design aligns with the visual directions and the storyline. Example tagline for the home page &ldquo;Challenge yourself. Get paid&rdquo; - showcase how much money have been awarded to date on the platform (<a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/community/statistics\">$89,648,059.6</a>). Please also think for other alternatives that showcase what is Topcoder.<br />\n<br />\nContent modules to consider for the home page:<br />\n- Hero area - visual showcase of Topcoder community platform<br />\n- Call to action (CTA) &ndash; &ldquo;Join the community&rdquo;<br />\n- Showcase for all the tracks (Design, Development, QA, Data Science &amp; Analytics, Competitive programming)<br />\n- Interesting challenges happening at the moment (an interesting challenge is one with higher prize or big name customer, challenging problem, etc.)<br />\n- Customer showcase - build trust for members that there&rsquo;s high quality work available<br />\n- Topcoder Open tournament information (general information about TCO which will have a link to go to this <a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/community/member-programs/topcoder-open/\">page</a>).&nbsp; In this section it will clearly be explained what is the event, allow access to past events, and help redirect potential sponsors to the appropriate business pages.<br />\n- Member showcase/success stories - from different tracks<br />\n- Secondary CTA for business - how to redirect to the Topcoder business website<br />\n<br />\n<strong>What are Tracks on Topcoder?</strong><br />\nThe new Topcoder community website would be organized by tracks: Design, Development, QA, Data Science &amp; Analytics, Competitive programming. Each track is a section that&nbsp; would focus on a specific contextual domain. Tracks would have content pages and challenge listings for their domain, and a track-specific section of the Topcoder Open. This would allow members within the track to easily find all that is relevant for them.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>2. Track Details Page</strong><br />\nEach track will have its mini-home page that is totally dedicated to the domain. The goal is to explain what the track is, what type of work is available, and more specific content - challenges, problems, statistics, etc. Each track would have a different structure depending on the domain, but there are several specific modules that you should try to design for the track main page.<br />\n<br />\nTry to redesign the Data Science and Analytics page as a sample page. Use content from <a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/\">https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/</a> and the section in general.<br />\n<br />\nContent modules:<br />\n- Hero area - Track positioning statement<br />\n- Call to action (CTA) - Join the community<br />\n- Track overview - what can I do here?<br />\n- Interesting challenges happening at the moment<br />\n- Track stats overview - member statistics, country statistics, challenge participation, best new members, etc. (you can take data from <a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/community/statistics\">Statistics</a> page)<br />\n- Customer project highlight area (ad)<br />\n- Track groups highlight. (Groups are sections that are focused on specific technology or company challenges - iOS group, Android group, IBM group, etc.).<br />\n- Topcoder Open latest updates - current stats, news, updates<br />\n- Member showcase/success stories - from different tracks<br />\n- Secondary CTA for business - how to redirect to the Topocder business website<br />\n<br />\nNote: each of the track details pages are focused on different content types &mdash; challenge listing, track statistics, problem listing, solutions, analysis, data sets, design gallery, and many more. We want to focus on the more content-heavy cases.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>3. Track Details - Data Set List Subpage</strong><br />\nWhat is a Data Set?<br />\nA data set is comprised of 2 data types: Training Data and Test Data. A simple example would be, when we want to create a machine learning algorithm to recognize your face. In the beginning, the machine needs to see multiple photos of you to &ldquo;learn&rdquo; how you look, we&rsquo;re basically training the model, and all those photos are called Training Data. Once the machine has learned how you look, we will want to give it some tests photos to see if it passes or fail. This is Test Data. You can train and test the machine at multiple times, so you create a history of data sets with specific dates.<br />\n<br />\nOn this page, you have to design an easy to scan list of Data sets. Use this page for content: <a href=\"https://community-app.topcoder.com/examples/contentful/viewport/74EiBlvrKT0ulWySYk1GIk\">https://community-app.topcoder.com/examples/contentful/viewport/74EiBlvrKT0ulWySYk1GIk</a>. Do not copy the page, but redesign it to align with your concept vision<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Content modules:</strong><br />\n- Title/header<br />\n- Dataset list<br />\n- What are datasets and how they work?<br />\n- Customer project highlight area (ad)<br />\n<br />\nEach listing to include:<br />\n- short, exciting description<br />\n- link to dataset source<br />\n- history of the dataset (simple statement of when the dataset was collected, what are the sources).<br />\n- solutions we&rsquo;ve built around this data (customer projects that benefited from the solutions, this will redirect to the business website).<br />\n<br />\n<strong>How to get started content:</strong><br />\n<em>Data is a valuable resource. It may contain important insights that will prove transformative for your business or for the world. But it is increasingly valuable for another reason as well: its use in training machine learning algorithms to perform reliably, efficiently, and accurately.<br />\nWith Topcoder Datasets you get access to high-quality, labeled data--some of which cannot be found anywhere else--and are given the tools to shape your own data as well. These data sets are intended to help you shape and strengthen algorithmic models and sharpen your data science abilities along the way.<br />\nWe recommend starting by exploring our keystone data sets, getting a better understanding of what they contain, and, if you&rsquo;re interested, try pairing them up with your algorithms or others found in Models &amp; Algos.</em><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Branding</strong><br />\n- Colors and fonts are up to you. All we require is to include the new navigation in your designs.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Stock Artwork &amp; Icons</strong><br />\n- Stock photos are allowed for this challenge. We&rsquo;d like you to think about the value of photography as design elements, and explore what are the best types of photography that would support the design.<br />\n- You can also use any photos from our <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/53993064@N03/albums/\">TC Flickr albums</a><br />\n- Make sure to declare all your assets properly or you might fail screening<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Target Devices</strong><br />\n- Web Desktop: 1280px width with height adjusted accordingly<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Marvel Prototype</strong><br />\n- Request a Marvel Prototype on forums or email keyla.blue1@gmail.com<br />\n- Provide clickable spots (hotzones) to link your screens and show the interactivity.<br />\n- We need you to upload your screens to Marvel App.<br />\n- You MUST include your Marvel App URL on your notes during submission upload (in your Marvel App prototype, click on share and then copy that link)<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Target Audience</strong><br />\n- Young people age 16-35 years old, who would be interested in registering on Topcoder<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Judging Criteria</strong><br />\n- How innovative your concept is?<br />\n- How easy is to read the team information?<br />\n- Is the design consistent and follows the GUI designs?<br />\n- Hierarchy and organization of content<br />\n- Overall design aesthetics<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Submission Deliverables<br />\nPreview Image</strong><br />\nPlease create your preview image as one (1) 1024x1024 JPG or PNG file in RGB color mode at 72dpi and place your submissions within it. You are free to resize or crop your submission to fit this size, but do not add any filters or elements for dramatic effect, such as drop shadows or reflections.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Submission File</strong><br />\nAll requested Contest Deliverables in JPG or PNG file format in RGB color mode at 72dpi.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Source Files</strong><br />\nAll original source files of the submitted design. Files should be created in Sketch, Photoshop, Illustrator, XD, etc.. Layers should be named and well organized.","descriptionFormat":"HTML","projectId":null,"created":"2019-03-28T21:45:43Z","createdBy":"DaraK","updated":"2019-04-12T13:10:39Z","updatedBy":"AutoPilot","timelineTemplateId":"4a59472b-0743-4dae-9739-1f5b327e1255","phases":[{"duration":172800,"scheduledEndDate":"2019-03-28T22:24:05Z","actualEndDate":"2019-03-28T22:24:05Z","isOpen":false,"name":"Specification

In summary this is what we want:\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Users will configure the contents of &quot;tactics&quot; which will be used by the scraper, the configuration will configure things like:\n\t<ol>\n\t\t<li>Users range: the users the scraper will use to scrape EC sites</li>\n\t\t<li>User agent list</li>\n\t\t<li>Request Interval</li>\n\t\t<li>Request Interval Random (Yes / No), defaults to No</li>\n\t\t<li>Proxy Server</li>\n\t\t<li>Retry Interval</li>\n\t\t<li>Retry Trial Count</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>The standard WebClient needs to be extended or encapsulated so that it will properly use these configured parameters:\n\t<ol>\n\t\t<li>It will only use the configured users to scrape EC sites</li>\n\t\t<li>It will randomly pick one of the configured user agents in the request for a specific user</li>\n\t\t<li>It will wait for the configured request interval between consecutive requests, and if the request interval random flag is Yes, it will randomize the request interval a bit instead of using fixed request intervals</li>\n\t\t<li>It will use the configured Proxy Server in the standard way</li>\n\t\t<li>It will wait for the specified interval before each retry, and will only retry for the specified count</li>\n\t</ol>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Update the scraper to use this new extended or encapsulated WebClient instead of the standard one. <strong><span style=\"background-color:#FFFF00\">Please note you do NOT have to extend the WebClient, you can also just encapsulate it with extra logic.</span></strong></li>\n\t<li><strong><span style=\"background-color:#FFFF00\">It&#39;s ok if these tactics cannot be applyed to every single physical request, but try to apply them as much as possible.</span></strong></li>\n\t<li>Please note

We need a predictive model for dynamic calculation of Yaw misalignment at every 10 minutes rolling for next 90 days by using historical SCADA Data and calculate optimum value for the period.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nIn wind turbines, correct nacelle alignment to main wind direction is necessary for optimum generation and improve the annual energy production. Lot of analysis &amp; reports says that 4 deg average will cause 1 % AEP loss<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nIdeally, Yaw offset should be zero degrees, but in a conservative way, business would like to keep the band within 0 to 2 degrees on either side.. The ultimate goal of this project is to optimize energy generation at each Wind Turbine Generator (WTG) by dynamic calculation of Yaw misalignment at every 10 min interval.</span></span>\n\n<h2><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:16pt\">Individual Requirements</span></h2>\n</div>\nIn the provided PBI file we need to plot&nbsp;<strong>Yaw</strong> column in the datasource as a scatter plot and plot the&nbsp;<strong>Optimal Yaw</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Abs Single Yaw</strong> as lines on the scatter plot.

Once raw data is imported, the user has the option to onboard it into a project (so project is essentially a grouping for a single migration activity - ex &ldquo;Upgrade Win7 to Win10 for Marketing Department&rdquo;. User will select the records from the database that aren&rsquo;t already onboarded to a different project and click the &ldquo;Publish&rdquo; button. That will create a new project record with the selected migration data records (users, computers, applications and departments). There will need to be an endpoint to list all the records in the database for displaying in the application dashboard. Sort and filter operations will be handled on the client side as the number of records will not be large.</span><br />\n\t<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Screens in scope:</span><br />\n\t<span style=\"background-color:transparent;

color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:calibri; font-size:12pt\">Named-Entity Recognition (NER) refers to the task of identifying both abstract and physical real-world objects in unstructured text. NER has numerous applications including, but not limited to, search, summarization, and question answering. </span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:calibri; font-size:12pt\">In this competition, you will be provided a dataset of annotated Arabic Wikipedia text data. The annotated entity types are: Person (&ldquo;PER&rdquo;), Organization (&ldquo;ORG&rdquo;), Location (&ldquo;LOC&rdquo;), and Miscellaneous (&ldquo;MIS&rdquo;). The goal is to develop an NER model that can accurately output position and entity type for all named entity mentions recognized within given input text.</span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<h2><strong>Input files</strong></h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family:arial; font-size:12pt\">We are using a public dataset in this challenge. The details can be found here: </span><a href=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/ArabicNER/\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:12pt\">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/ArabicNER/</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family:arial; font-size:12pt\">. </span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The corpus contains 28 hand-annotated Arabic Wikipedia articles. In total, this amounts to 74,000 tokens. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Every article has its own input file. Each of these files has one line per token, and each line consists of the token in UTF-8 encoding and the corresponding tag. The tags are in &ldquo;BIO&rdquo; format. For example, &ldquo;B-PER&rdquo; indicates that the token is the first token of a &ldquo;Person&rdquo; entity mention, &ldquo;I-PER&rdquo; indicates that the token is inside a multi-token &ldquo;Person&rdquo; entity mention but is not the first token of the entity mention, and &ldquo;O&rdquo; indicates that the token does not belong to an entity mention. The Miscellaneous annotations are broken down by subtype (&ldquo;MIS0&rdquo;, &ldquo;MIS1&rdquo;, &ldquo;MIS2&rdquo;, &ldquo;MIS3&rdquo;). For this competition, we will lump all of these entities into one entity type, &ldquo;MIS&rdquo;.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">We have split the dataset into the train, dev, and test sets as follows.</span></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Train</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\"> (14 files): </span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-family:consolas; font-size:11pt\">Computer_Software.txt, Ibn_Tolun_Mosque.txt, Linux.txt, Soccer_Worldcup.txt, Crusades.txt, Imam_Hussein_Shrine.txt, Periodic_Table.txt, X_window_system.txt, Damascus.txt, Islamic_Golden_Age.txt, Portugal_football_team.txt, Enrico_Fermi.txt, Light.txt, Real_Madrid.txt</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Dev</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\"> (7 files): </span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-family:consolas; font-size:11pt\">Atom.txt, Football.txt, Raul_Gonzales.txt, Richard_Stallman.txt, Computer.txt, Nuclear_Power.txt, Razi.txt</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Test</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\"> (7 files): </span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-family:consolas; font-size:11pt\">Christiano_Ronaldo.txt, Islamic_History.txt, Solaris.txt, Ummaya_Mosque.txt, Internet.txt, Physics.txt, Summer_Olympics2004.txt</span></p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">We will merge these files and shuffle the sentence order into three files, i.e., train.txt, dev.txt, and test.txt (the link to processed data: </span><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/holwu4hsbpsxw6l/to_contestant_V2.zip?dl=1\">https://www.dropbox.com/s/holwu4hsbpsxw6l/to_contestant_V2.zip?dl=1</a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">). You must train your model based on the provided train.txt only. But you can use any unlabeled dataset to train word embedding or language model, as long as the licenses of the datasets allow us to use the developed model commercially. More importantly, the hyper-parameter tuning should not rely on the dev.txt and test.txt, while you can use the train.txt for cross-validations.</span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Output file</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">We expect your model will produce a csv file (</span><strong>solution.csv</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">) containing text filename, corresponding start and end positions (the line number in the text file), entity types (3-letter code), confidence scores (0 to 1), and extracted named entity mentions, as follows. </span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Text filename, start position, end position, entity type, score, Named entity mention 1 </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Text filename, start position, end position, entity type, score, Named entity mention 2</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">&hellip;</span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Here is an example:</span><br />\nFilename,Start,End,Type,Score,Surface <span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\"> </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">train.txt,7,7,PER,1.0,&quot;������������������&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">train.txt,29,29,LOC,</span><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:14.6667px\">1.0,</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">&quot;����������������������&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">train.txt,49,49,LOC,</span><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:14.6667px\">1.0,</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">&quot;����������&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">train.txt,56,56,PER,0</span><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:14.6667px\">.8,</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">&quot;��������&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">&hellip;</span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Please note that the &ldquo;extracted named entity mentions&rdquo; is only listed for reference and will not be used in evaluation.</span></p>\n\n<h2><strong>Submission format</strong></h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">This match uses a combination of the &quot;submit data&quot; and &quot;submit code&quot; submission styles.

This means that at least the</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-family:courier new; font-size:11pt\"> /code/dockerfile</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\"> must be present from day 1, even if it doesn&#39;t describe any meaningful system to be built.

If you successfully complete multiple sets of test cases, then you will be awarded a prize for each one completed.</li>\n\t<li>If you execute a test case and miss an issue that is found by the reviewer, then you are on risk losing payment for that test case.

font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Facial re-id is a cornerstone capability in many forward-looking applications. The ability to not only detect faces, but also distinguish if a face has been seen before has a broad range of applications. From robot-human interactions to biometric user identification, the ability to distinguish people from each other and recognize someone that has been seen before is an empowering capability. This competition is interested in an algorithm capable of performing facial re-id on a dataset containing multiple images of multiple people. The dataset has a number of heterogeneous image conditions and environments, including varying lighting, posture, occlusion and blurriness. This challenge aims to develop a facial re-id algorithm that can identify various people across images, reporting when it sees a person that it has been trained to recognize. The model should also be capable of localizing the position of the face in the context of the full scene.</span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000; font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Your task will be to detect bounding boxes containing faces from images captured from video frames. The bounding boxes and the person identifiers you detect will be compared to ground truth, the quality of your solution will be measured using the mean average precision metric.</span></p>\n\n<h2><strong>Input files</strong></h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000; font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">This contest uses a data set that was prepared for a recent similar contest, see this page for details: </span><a href=\"https://vast.uccs.edu/Opensetface/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>[Opensetface]</u></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000; font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">. You will need to agree to the Data Usage Terms on [Opensetface] before downloading the files. </span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000; font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Most of the information described at [Opensetface] is valid for the current contest as well, but be mindful about some important differences:</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000; font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">[Opensetface] describes two tasks: face detection and face recognition. This current contest concerns only the face recognition task. However, there is a separate contest about face detection as well, running in parallel to this contest, using the same input data.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000; font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The scoring metric is different, see below at Scoring for details.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000; font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The format of the required output is different, see below at Output file and Submission format for details.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Important notes</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000; font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">:</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000; font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Use only the images found in the Training folder of the [Opensetface] data access page. This contest uses different images for provisional and final testing than those listed in the Testing and Validation folders of [Opensetface]. </span><strong>Using Opensetface&#39;s testing and validation data for training is strictly prohibited</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000; font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">.

This means that if you use large files (external libraries, data files, pretained model files, etc) that won&#39;t fit into this limit, then your docker build process must download these from the net during building. There are several ways to achieve this, e.g. external libraries may be installed from a git repository, data files may be downloaded using wget or curl from Dropbox or Google Drive or any other public file hosting service. In any case always make sure that your build process is carefully tested end to end before you submit your package for final testing. </span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000; font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">During final testing your last submission file will be used to build your docker container.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000; font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Make sure that the contents of the </span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000; font-family:courier new; font-size:11pt\">/solution</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000; font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\"> and </span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000; font-family:courier new; font-size:11pt\">/code</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000; font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\"> folders are in sync, i.e. your </span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000; font-family:courier new; font-size:11pt\">solution.csv</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000; font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\"> file contains the exact output of the current version of your code. </span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000; font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">To speed up the final testing process the contest admins may decide not to build and run the dockerized version of each contestant&#39;s submission.

color:#000000; font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Facial detection is a problem that has received a significant amount of attention from both the Deep Learning and Biometric communities in the last few years. However, most facial detection models are trained on datasets that lack diversity in pose, levels of occlusion, blurriness and other important properties. This competition is interested in an algorithm capable of performing Facial Detection on a dataset containing multiple images of multiple people. The images may be badly illuminated and vary in terms of quality, blurriness and occlusion. The faces inside these images are of various poses and shapes. In this challenge, we hope to develop a facial detection model which may be utilized in real-world application including surveillance, where there is a huge need for such models and yet a good preforming algorithm does not exist.</span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000; font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Your task will be to detect bounding boxes containing faces from images captured from video frames. The bounding boxes you detect will be compared to ground truth, the quality of your solution will be measured using the mean average precision metric.</span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong>Input files</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000; font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">This contest uses a data set that was prepared for a recent similar contest, see this page for details: </span><a href=\"https://vast.uccs.edu/Opensetface/\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><u>[Opensetface]</u></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:#000000; font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">.

This means that if you use large files (external libraries, data files, pretained model files, etc) that won&#39;t fit into this limit, then your docker build process must download these from the net during building. There are several ways to achieve this, e.g. external libraries may be installed from a git repository, data files may be downloaded using wget or curl from Dropbox or Google Drive or any other public file hosting service.

font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">We recently changed the flow of the email change functionality on our backend and we need to apply the required changes on the frontend to make this work.</span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The following changes need to be done in the Settings page.</span></p>\n\n<h3><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(67, 67, 67); font-family:arial; font-size:14pt\">1. Handle SSO users</span></h3>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">If the user was logged in using SSO (there will be a flag in the user object), clicking on the &quot;Change email&quot; button, an error message should appear above the button saying: &nbsp;&quot;Since you joined Topcoder using your &lt;SSO Service&gt; account, any password updates will need to be handled by logging in to your &lt;SSO Service&gt; account.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<h3><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(67, 67, 67); font-family:arial; font-size:14pt\">2. Handle normal users</span></h3>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Initially the &ldquo;Send Verification Email&rdquo; button should be disabled.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">When the user enters a valid email address that&rsquo;s not the same with the current email address, enable the &ldquo;Send Verification Email&rdquo; button. Clicking that button should show a simple popup message saying &quot;Verification email sent to &lt;new email&gt;. Check your inbox and click on the link in the email to finish updating your email. If you can&#39;t find it, check your spam folder.&quot;.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">There should be a blue (primary) &ldquo;Close&rdquo; button to close the popup.</span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">You need to update the request query based on the provided Swagger definition. The changes is that we now pass a </span><strong>verifyUrl </strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">parameter which will be configured in the community-app and will be the full URL of the new page from the requirement bellow.</span></p>\n\n<h3><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(67, 67, 67); font-family:arial; font-size:14pt\">3. Implement email verification landing page</span></h3>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Route: /settings/account/verifyEmail</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Query parameters:</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">token - String.

This project is a Proof of Concept, so the entire application will be larger than what we are designing here and this is the reason we are not going to show all the user flows.\n<h3 class='roundLabel'>Round 1</h3>Submit your initial designs for checkpoint review.<br />\n1.Splash Page<br />\n2.Login<br />\n4.Claims Landing Page<br />\n5.Report a Claim &ndash; Existing User<br />\n6.Report a Claim &ndash; Fill Information<br />\n7.Claim Status and Handler<br />\n8.Claim Dashboard<br />\n<br />\n- Important: As part of your checkpoint submission, you must upload your submission to MarvelApp so we can provide direct feedback on your designs.<br />\n- Please ask in the Forum for a MarvelApp prototype link. You will receive 1 MarvelApp prototype for Desktop.<br />\n- Make sure to include a URL/Link to your design within your &quot;notes.txt&quot;, Important!<br />\n- Make sure all pages have correct flow! Use correct file numbering. (00, 01, 02, 03).\n<h3 class='roundLabel'>Round 2</h3>Submit your final designs plus checkpoint feedback implemented<br />\n1.Splash Page<br />\n2.Login<br />\n3.Registration<br />\n4.Claims Landing Page<br />\n5.Report a Claim &ndash; Existing User<br />\n6.Report a Claim &ndash; Fill Information<br />\n7.Claim Status and Handler<br />\n8.Claim Dashboard<br />\n9.Claim Details<br />\n10.Claim Follow Up<br />\n11.Chat<br />\n12.Products<br />\n13.Risk Engineering<br /><strong>Background&nbsp; Information</strong><br />\nThis is a banking application used by brokers, customers and employees to report a claim or see details about the submitted claims. For this particular project, there is a special user flow, as the claim is not associated to a username/insured employee name,&nbsp; but to the company&rsquo;s policy, so the claim has to be searched by number and date of loss&nbsp; all the time (any improvements/suggestions on the flow should be based on this).<br />\n<br />\n<strong>User Story</strong><br />\nHank is a customer who has just downloaded this application and wants to report a claim. Once he enters the application he sees several options where he could go such as Products, Risk Engineering, Claims, About Us, Contact Us, Chat and Login. He goes to claims section and he sees the Claims Landing Page where he has the option to Report a Claim. From there he is asked if he has an account to login or just wants to go directly to report the claim. He goes with the last option. Now he can report a claim and fill all the details of it. As he is not registered yet, he will complete more detailed information about him so the system will also make him an account once he submits the claims.<br />\n<br />\nThe claim is submitted and he is now redirected to Claims Landing Page. He wants to see its status and who&rsquo;s the handler, so he will go to Claim Status &amp; Handler page, where he will input the date of loss and claim number. If he wants to see all the filled information in his claim, he goes to the Claim Details. He now remembers that he forgot to add some notes and photos so he presses the Claim Follow-Up button to do that. On this page he can upload any text PDF or additional photos needed.<br />\n<br />\nThe system is throwing an error when submitting the additional information so he goes needs help and he goes to chat. There he finds a chat bot which turns useful in solving the problem and the new data is successfully added.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Key Items to Focus On</strong><br />\n- This application must look and feel modern, clean and professional.<br />\n- Easy and intuitive user experience for tech and non tech users.<br />\n- It&rsquo;s important to follow the customer&rsquo;s branding guideline in terms of fonts, colors, etc.<br />\n- Keep in mind this is an iOS application to design with specific features<br />\n- Make your design stand out on a first view!<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Screen Requirements</strong><br />\nFor this challenge, we are looking for the below pages to be designed/considered in your concepts. Do not allow the suggestions below to impact the creativity of design. If there is a better way to accomplish the same goal, then feel free to take creative liberties.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>1. Splash Page</strong><br />\nThis is the first page the user first sees when he opens the application. It contains the following items:<br />\n-Products<br />\n-Risk Engineering<br />\n-Claims<br />\n-About Us<br />\n-Contact Us<br />\n-Chat<br />\n-Login (if user is logged in, he can see his profile photo/user ID and an option to logout).<br />\n<br />\nFeel free to represent the above items as cards or with photos or icons, whatever you think looks best.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>2. Login</strong><br />\nIf the user has an account he can login from this page that has:<br />\n-Sample logo (create a simple logo)<br />\n-Username<br />\n-Password<br />\n-Login button<br />\n-Option to register<br />\n<br />\nOnce the user logs in he will be taken to the splash page with logged in information.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>3. Registration</strong><br />\nThe user can create an account for Juno application here. The page should include:<br />\n-Sample logo<br />\n-Username<br />\n-Password<br />\n-Name<br />\n-Email<br />\n-Phone<br />\n-Type of user: broker, customer, other<br />\n-Register button<br />\n<br />\n<strong>4. Claims Landing Page</strong><br />\nFrom the Splash page, the user chooses to go to Claims. On this page he sees some active links (which are developed in this application) and inactive links which will be developed at a later stage in the future (not in scope of application).<br />\n<br />\nThis page acts as a portal to reporting a&nbsp; claim or finding out more information on an ongoing claim. Customers may also access and view entries of submitted claims, or add new information to the claim.<br />\n<br />\nActive Links:<br />\n- Report a Claim (automobile claim)<br />\n- View My Claim Status and Handler<br />\n- Claims Details<br />\n- Run a loss report<br />\n<br />\nInactive Links:<br />\n- Recent Searches<br />\n- Analytics and reporting<br />\n- Customer care center<br />\n- Legal services<br />\n- Vehicle owners claim<br />\n<br />\n<strong>5. Report a Claim &ndash; Existing User</strong><br />\nWhen the user clicks to report a claim he will be taken to a page where he will be asked if he has an account and be able to see 2 options:<br />\n- Yes, take me to Login<br />\n- No, go and report the claim<br />\n<br />\n<strong>6. Report a Claim &ndash; Fill Information</strong><br />\nFor this flow we assume that the user doesn&rsquo;t have an account so he will go to <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zpd_VZMjvNteI9gshNKNxjbfjGUIO87l/view?usp=sharing\">this page</a> to complete the fields to report the claim. These are the same fields a logged in user would see, the only difference is that for the non-registered user in Reported by section, he will see the following:<br />\n- Name<br />\n- Phone number (should show next to it the message: &ldquo;We will be sending you a 6 digit code to validate your phone number&rdquo;)<br />\n- Email<br />\n- User ID<br />\n- Password<br />\n- Type of user: broker, customer, other<br />\n<br />\nWe&#39;d like to display all the above fields on this page.<br />\n<br />\nOnce the user completes these and the rest of the claim details, the system will register the claim and will make an account for him.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>7. Claim Status and Handler</strong><br />\nIf the user wants to see the claim status and the handler of his claim, without seeing all the details he can search for the claim <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1osCS5YAzC9z9Z7MJ1LE8cGVeGs9w-v8J/view?usp=sharing\">here</a> by filling the next fields:<br />\n- Date of Loss<br />\n- Claim Number<br />\n<br />\nThen user will be then taken to the claim dashboard.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>8. Claim Dashboard</strong><br />\nOn this page the user will see the following:<br />\n- Claim handler<br />\n- Claim status<br />\n- Required actions from the claims team for the user to complete: like adding information that&#39;s not been received or upload a photo or supporting document, like an ID.<br />\n- We need a section for the user to perform complete new information that is required by the handler like for example: show the option to upload a document.<br />\n- Link to Claim Follow-Up page<br />\n- Link to Claim Details page<br />\n<br />\nClaim handler will include:<br />\n- name<br />\n- email<br />\n- phone number<br />\n<br />\nClaim Status:<br />\nShould display the states a claim has gone through so far, what is active now(in progress) and what is coming up next. This can be represented as a breadcrumb timeline with the following states:<br />\n- The claim has been received (completed)<br />\n- We assigned a claim handler (completed)<br />\n- The claim is investigated by John Doe (in progress)<br />\n- We&rsquo;ll get back to you&nbsp; (upcoming)<br />\n- We mailed a check to you (upcoming)<br />\n<br />\n<strong>9. Claim Details</strong><br />\nFor the user to get to this page he will have to search again by the date of loss and claim number (similar to Claim Status and Handler page). Here the user can see all the information he submitted on the Report a Claim page, in a non-editable form. In addition, the page will also show:<br />\n- claim number<br />\n- date of loss<br />\n- claim status<br />\n- claim handler data<br />\n- option to follow up (provide additional new information)<br />\n<br />\n<strong>10. Claim Follow Up</strong><br />\nIf the user has more details to add to the insurance after he submitting he has the option to do that here as he will be displayed with a:<br />\n- Free form text area<br />\n- Option to upload pictures or documents<br />\n- Submit button<br />\n<br />\nNote: the user cannot edit the existing information due to insurance rules, he can only add new one.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>11. Chat</strong><br />\nWhen a person needs help with the claim, they can reach the chat easy and fast. Here we have a chatbot in place which has different options as in the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oj36LNthC52oMC-lp0vb953BDqu6VtFa/view?usp=sharing\">screenshot</a>.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>12. Products</strong><br />\nThe products page is accessed from Splash page and should have a gallery of existing products like <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LeUX_BiAWTmepU5EEOqBuYbaEB6Y_4ik/view?usp=sharing\">here</a>. Each product will have a photo, name and a short description. You can use the information from the example (photo+text). From this page, there is no need to show a product details page.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>13. Risk Engineering</strong><br />\nThis page is accessed from Splash page should have a gallery of existing risk management solutions like <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iwc0zAdaPeO5rb5-_QioiBpYFsswoPqd/view?usp=sharing\">here</a>. Each product will have a photo, name and a short description. You can use the information from the example(photo+text).

Http Preconnect Fix","description":"<div>Welcome to the ElectronJs Http Preconnect Fix</div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;\n<h2><strong>Challenge Objectives</strong></h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>In this project we are aiming to fix one issue of the Electron App that doesn&#39;t support HTTP Preconnect. A useful resource to understand preconnect is here&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.keycdn.com/blog/resource-hints\" style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\">https://www.keycdn.com/blog/resource-hints</a>.</li>\n\t<li>This will be the last of the series of challenges to update the&nbsp;ElectronJs s</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\n<strong>Challenge Background</strong></h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Our client make use Electron for one of their internal applications.</li>\n\t<li>It has requested Topcoder to help resolve a preconnect issue for the core Electron project owned by the open-source community.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Technology Stack</strong></h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>C/C++</li>\n\t<li>Javascript</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><br />\n<strong>Individual Requirements</strong></h2>\n<br />\n1. You will need to provide a solution for the HTTP preconnect issue to be incorporated into Electron (<a href=\"https://electronjs.org/\" style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\">https://electronjs.org</a>) source code. The issue is described in Github -&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/16476\" style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\">https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/16476</a><br />\n<br />\n2. An intial solution will be provided in forum. However, we advise to use this repository <a href=\"https://github.com/coderReview/electron\">https://github.com/coderReview/electron</a> (master branch) as starting point as it&#39;s already merged with lastest master branch and has also a Lint fix. <u><strong>The solution is not guaranteed to work and must be updated to meet the specifications detailed below.</strong></u><br />\n<br />\n3. The fix should cover the following requirements:\n<ul>\n\t<li>When a page provides a preconnect resource hint via a response header or link tag, it should preemptively preconnect to the specified domain</li>\n\t<li>When loading a page that hasn&#39;t been seen before, it should preemptively open 2 connections to the origin</li>\n\t<li>When loading a page that has been seen before, it may use collected data from previous visits to preemptively open however many connections it believes are likely to be necessary</li>\n\t<li>The main goal is that we are able to preconnect the maximum number (6) of HTTP connections.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>We are concerned that due to a recent change in Chromium 66, the learning behaviour based on previous visits now works differently and is not going to be sufficient to meet this goal.</li>\n\t\t<li>Should that prove to be the case, we would like an explicit option we can use in Electron to request preconnects instead of the learning behaviour. This should be a new option for the BrowserWindow constructor or its loadURL method</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br />\n4. Electron coding style should be followed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://electronjs.org/docs/development/coding-style\">https://electronjs.org/docs/development/coding-style</a> and <strong>npm run lint</strong> must pass<br />\n<br />\n5. Winner will be asked to update the PR <a href=\"https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/17487\">https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/17487</a>.</p>\n\n<h2><br />\n<strong>Acceptance criteria</strong></h2>\n<br />\nHTTP Preconnect must work.<br />\n<br />\nThe best solution may be by having an Electron API for specifically requesting preconnects, however we are open about whether this is done by making the Chromium feature available.<br />\n<br />\n1.<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; A test</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>application&nbsp;</strong><strong>running&nbsp;</strong><strong>within&nbsp;</strong><strong>Electron&nbsp;</strong><strong>should be&nbsp;</strong><strong>able&nbsp;</strong><strong>to&nbsp;</strong><strong>have&nbsp;</strong><strong>the&nbsp;</strong><strong>maximum&nbsp;</strong><strong>number</strong><strong>(6)&nbsp;</strong><strong>of&nbsp;</strong><strong>HTTP&nbsp;</strong><strong>connections&nbsp;</strong><strong>preconnected</strong><br />\n<br />\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adequate test/example cases must be provided to demonstrate that the solution works by:\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\n\t<li><strong>Explicit option for Electron BrowserWindow (should it prove necessary to achieve 6 connections):&nbsp;&nbsp;a standalone example is provided as an example of usage</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>Making the underlying Chromium behaviour available: the reproduction cases on the GitHub issue are solved</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<br />\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The source code must be optimized following the best practices of the Electron architecture and well documented</div>\n<br /><br /><h2>Final Submission Guidelines</h2><ul>\n\t<li>Patch to the ElectronJs repository</li>\n\t<li>Deployment and

customers.\n\n<h2>Project Background</h2>\nHestia is a wholesale distributor of a variety of plumbing and building-related products. In an effort to stay competitive, ahead of the technology curve, and to offer customers the best and easiest way for them to do business, Hestia wants to understand the data of thousands of their loyal customers. Hestia has engaged Topcoder to perform data science work on their huge volume of data to gain a lot of insights.&nbsp;\n\n<h2>Challenge Details</h2>\nHestia has multiple business centers (&ldquo;branches&rdquo;) with a network of warehouses associated with each business center. Each business center has its own data system. This possesses challenges for data science work.\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>There can be same customer purchasing from multiple business centers and you cannot take customer id as a unique identifier. These customers are duplicate buyers.</li>\n\t<li>Invoice numbers can be overlapped across branches</li>\n\t<li>Invoices will be &ldquo;rolled over&rdquo; which means same number can be repeated after few years</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\nBased on the dataset provided in the forum you have to perform the following.\n<ul>\n\t<li>Data Analysis (preferably using Python 3)</li>\n\t<li>Documentation that covers the following to evaluate your solution.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Hypothesis building - Identify all possible columns that can be used for clustering\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>For example, demographics of the customer</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Shipping Address</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>Data Cleaning - Whether there are any outliers exist?

works.</li>\n\t<li>You will be focused on creating a highly impactful graphics and explanation text while keeping it simple and easy to understand for technical and non-technical users.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class='roundLabel'>Round 1</h3>Submit your initial designs for checkpoint review by the following personas:<br />\n1) Full infographic including 3 required items<br />\n<br />\n- Important: As part of your checkpoint submission, you must add your design into a Google Slide presentation, and provide the link with &ldquo;Edit&rdquo; mode enable, so we can add comments directly.\n<h3 class='roundLabel'>Round 2</h3>Submit your final designs plus checkpoint feedback implemented<br />\n1) Full infographic including 3 required items<br />\n<br />\n- Important: As part of your final submission, you must update your previous Google Slides link, and implement the feedback left within the presentation.<br /><strong>Challenge Instructions</strong><br />\nThe Google Slides document should focus on the following 3 items:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Explain what Topcoder is -- describe what Topcoder is (for example, we are a community, a platform, but most of all a place for clients to design/develop software)</li>\n\t<li>Explain step by step what Crowdsourcing means</li>\n\t<li>Describes how to atomize a set of objectives into a project, and how that project is then run on Topcoder</li>\n</ul>\nNOTE: Please feel free to copy whatever you want from topcoder.com -- however: we really want you to be as creative as possible, and come up with original descriptions/content.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>IMPORTANT - Design considerations!!</strong><br />\n- You are free to split this into 3 different slides or merge everything into a single and highly visual deck.<br />\n- This presentation should be more graphical and less text.<br />\n- The graphics should convince or compel viewers to understand the purpose of this challenge.<br />\n- Infographic Size: Design with a resolution of 1920px width by 1080px height. Use Google Slides to showcase your design.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Required Screens</strong><br />\n<strong>1) What is Topcoder?</strong><br />\n- Topcoder is home to a global, on-demand network of designers and technologists. We help businesses of all sizes design and build amazing digital solutions &mdash; fast.<br />\n- More content: <a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/about/\">https://www.topcoder.com/about/</a>.<br />\n- Please feel free to use your own words and create your own content.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>2) Step by Step what Crowdsourcing means</strong><br />\n- Crowdsourcing is a term that gets thrown around a lot &mdash; yet is often misunderstood. Some equate crowdsourcing with crowdfunding or ideation, while others mistake crowdsourcing for a methodology that&rsquo;s inherently risky and informal.<br />\n- But for forward-thinking startups and enterprises, crowdsourcing provides a reliable way to turn the gig economy into a strategic advantage.<br />\n- With an enterprise-ready crowdsourcing platform like Topcoder, networks of talented, motivated technologists can be activated on demand to generate new ideas and solutions at scale.<br />\n- Crowdsourcing through Topcoder: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc_PcN6ECjg\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc_PcN6ECjg</a><br />\n- More content: <a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/about/crowdsourcing/\">https://www.topcoder.com/about/crowdsourcing/</a><br />\n- Please feel free to use your own words and create your own content.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>3) Describes how to atomize a set of objectives into a project, and how that project is then run on Topcoder</strong><br />\n- Explain how we break down software design/development into challenges.<br />\n- More information about what topcoder offers: <a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/solutions/\">https://www.topcoder.com/solutions/</a><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Branding Guidelines</strong><br />\n- No branding guidelines - please be as creative as possible.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Final Deliverables</strong><br />\n- All original source files.<br />\n- Files should be created in Adobe Photoshop and saved as a layered PSD file and Adobe Illustrator or as a layered AI file.<br />\n- A Google slide link with your deck design presentation.<br />\n- Separate PNG/JPG files with your original artwork.","descriptionFormat":"HTML","projectId":23438,"created":"2019-03-18T20:16:42Z","createdBy":"chekspir","updated":"2019-04-04T15:22:57Z","updatedBy":"AutoPilot","timelineTemplateId":"4a59472b-0743-4dae-9739-1f5b327e1255","phases":[{"duration":172800,"scheduledEndDate":"2019-03-19T00:35:54Z","actualEndDate":"2019-03-19T00:35:54Z","isOpen":false,"name":"Specification

UI/UX Designer Talent Pool Challenge","description":"<strong>Challenge Summary</strong><br />\nWelcome to the Topcoder UI/UX Designer Talent Pool Challenge! In this challenge, we want you to showcase your talents to help us identify potential UX/UI designers that will be invited to join a talent pool and work closely with the Topcoder Product team to scale our design efforts.&nbsp; This is going to be a challenge that will have 5 equal prizes. The challenge will have a different review process than the typical review, so please pay attention.&nbsp; It will be very iterative with a lot of feedback sessions.<br /><strong>Challenge Format</strong><br />\nSubmit your designs of the Topcoder Registration page (Desktop and Mobile responsive) in the following order as soon as you are ready for them to be reviewed:<br />\n1. UX Research &ndash; Review 1<br />\n2. UX Research &ndash; Review 2 - Deadline: March 22, 09:00 AM EST<br />\n3. UI Mock &ndash; Review 1<br />\n4. UI Mock &ndash; Review 2 - Deadline: March 27, 09:00 AM EST<br />\n5. UI Mock &ndash; Review 3 - Deadline: April 1, 09:00 AM EST (note: you <strong>CAN </strong>submit to this stage, even if you didn&#39;t submit before anything!)<br />\n6. UI Specification &ndash; Review 1<br />\n7. UI Specification &ndash; Review 2 - Final deadline: April 4, 09:00 AM EST<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Full Description &amp; Project Guide</strong><br />\n<strong>Background Overview</strong><br />\nFor this challenge we want to identify designers that are equally versed in UI and UX design. The goal is to examine the problems, build the UI, and the final development specification of a single front-end component.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>THE CHALLENGE</strong><br />\nThis project is about designing an improved version of the Topcoder registration experience: <a href=\"https://accounts.topcoder.com/member/registration\">https://accounts.topcoder.com/member/registration</a><br />\n<br />\nIn order to do that, it&rsquo;s mandatory to follow a couple of steps in the below order. These steps will be similar to what you will do if you&rsquo;re going to join the Topcoder Design pool.<br />\n<strong>1. UX Research:</strong> Research and suggest an improved flow for the Topcoder registration experience.<br />\n<strong>2. UI Mock:</strong> Build the UI Mock of the registration interface. Showcase the component states.<br />\n<strong>3. UI Design Specification:</strong> Build the specification of the registration component:<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; - ALL states of the UI<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; - ALL breakpoints<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; - Mobile and Desktop<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp; - Sub Components Used<br />\n<br />\n<strong>IMPORTANT</strong><br />\nWe want to explore your process and evaluate the UX and UI skills. Please focus on a single flow (registration) but explore all the cases, list all the problems you can think of. We DO NOT want you to digress with additional flows such as lost password, social login, Single Sign On, email verification, 2-step authentication, etc..<br />\n<br />\n<strong>REVIEW PROCESS</strong><br />\nThis is a different type of review. We are open to provide 2 feedback sessions per stage &mdash; UX research, UI mock, UI specification &mdash; for a total of 6. The goal is to identify how you work with a design team in an iterative setting. The reviews will be on demand &mdash; as soon as you have a completed set of artifacts, submit them and post in the forum that you are ready for a review. Please ask questions for clarification - we value the questions you ask as much as the final deliverables you&rsquo;ll show us.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>DESIGN BRIEF</strong><br />\nWe want to evaluate your UX and UI design skills with a simple challenge. The end goal is to build a registration component. The challenge is aimed to emulate the iterative process of product design, so please be proactive and ask questions to ensure you&rsquo;ll be successful.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>1. UX Research</strong><br />\nThe registration flow should be based on the current process on Topcoder, and we would assume the same data and functions are to be carried over. Please research and recommend improvements in the overall UX flow for registration. The goal is to have a new community member registered quickly and painlessly.<br />\n<br />\nAt this stage we care about UX Analysis and Research, what can be done better. This should be a UX report which should show which is the problem, potential solutions, comparison of best practices. Here&rsquo;s a very simple example: <a href=\"http://www.alexislucio.com/#/sysdig-spotlight/\">http://www.alexislucio.com/#/sysdig-spotlight/</a>&nbsp; (Research and Insights)<br />\n<br />\nYou can search how other companies are treating their registration page to come up with new ideas and solutions. Think about a plan to improve the registration component, you can add annotations on a screenshot of existing page or any other method that works for you.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>2. UI Mock</strong><br />\nThe UI exploration should start with exploring 2 directions for style that will align with our brand, but should strive to improve the overall aesthetics of the page - layout, typography, hierarchy, color, scale, etc.<br />\nThis part is about concepts and UI effective designing in Sketch. It&rsquo;s what we are used to do on a regular challenge. Here&#39;s the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wLvIYoM_Mi4fqevVRaNBj92KNWuLzwwg\">Topcoder logo</a> to use.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>3. UI Design Specification</strong><br />\nBased on the UI directions a final component specification of the registration will be required, outlining all the states of the components so a developer can look at your specification and develop the components in code. This should include all interactive states of all components, flow states with content and cases &mdash; empty, editing, error, short password, very long password, etc..<br />\nHere&rsquo;s an example of a specification:<br />\n<a href=\"https://marvelapp.com/896b1jd/screen/54501169\">https://marvelapp.com/896b1jd/screen/54501169</a><br />\n<br />\n<em><strong>For this </strong></em><em><strong>challenge</strong></em><em><strong> you should use Sketch only!</strong></em><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Stock Artwork &amp; Icons</strong><br />\n-&nbsp; Public stock photo and icons are not allowed in this challenge. You can only use photos taken by you or from our <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/53993064@N03/\">Topcoder Flickr album</a>. All the icons should be created by you.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Sizes</strong><br />\nThis design should be an adaptive one so you should follow the below sizes for different breakpoints:<br />\nWeb: 900px (min on desktop), 1024px, 1280px, 1600+px<br />\nMobile: 320px, 375px&nbsp; (can use same resolution as for web and export at double size)<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Marvel Prototype</strong><br />\n- Request a Marvel Prototype on forums or email keyla.blue1@gmail.com<br />\n- Provide clickable spots (hotzones) to link your screens and show the interactivity.<br />\n- We need you to upload your screens to Marvel App.<br />\n- You MUST include your Marvel App URL on your notes during submission upload (in your Marvel App prototype, click on share and then copy that link)<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Target Audience</strong><br />\n-Topcoder members and customers<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Judging Criteria</strong><br />\n- Familiarity with the 3 stages of UX Research, UI Mock and UI Specifications<br />\n- How good your UX Research skills are<br />\n- How clean your UI Mockup design is<br />\n- How complete your UI Specifications are<br />\n- Overall design aesthetics<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Submission Deliverables</strong><br />\n<strong>Preview Image</strong><br />\nPlease create your preview image as one (1) 1024x1024 JPG or PNG file in RGB color mode at 72dpi and place your submissions within it. You are free to resize or crop your submission to fit this size, but do not add any filters or elements for dramatic effect, such as drop shadows or reflections.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Submission File</strong><br />\nAll requested Contest Deliverables in JPG or PNG file format in RGB color mode at 72dpi.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Source Files</strong><br />\nAll original Sketch source files of

For now, we won&rsquo;t change anything in Connect but we just want to explore the possibility of using the form rendering logic as standalone app e.g. if that new app is hosted at </span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:courier new; font-size:11pt\">forms.topcoder.com</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\"> then calling </span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:courier new; font-size:11pt\">forms.topcoder.com/forms/95</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\"> would render the form with template id being 95. We should be able to post form data by clicking on Submit button to an HTTP URL specified in the template itself. This way we would technically be able to use our form rendering logic for any sort of forms/surveys we use at present in Topcoder.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:16pt\">Technology Stack</span></h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">React</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Redux</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">CSS Modules</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Node.js</span></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:16pt\">Code access</span></h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Connect App repo </span><a href=\"https://github.com/appirio-tech/connect-app\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">https://github.com/appirio-tech/connect-app</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\"> branch </span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:courier new; font-size:11pt\">dev</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">User for Connect app is provided on the forum.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:16pt\">Individual requirements</span></h2>\n\n<h4><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:arial; font-size:12pt\">Overview</span></h4>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The new React Form should work like this:</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">We should be able to open form by the template id like </span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-family:courier new; font-size:11pt\">http://localhost:3000/forms/&lt;template id&gt;</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">We should see the form rendered the same way as it&rsquo;s done in Connect App: </span><a href=\"https://connect.topcoder-dev.com/new-project/form-example\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-size:11pt\">https://connect.topcoder-dev.com/new-project/form-example</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\"> </span><br />\n\t<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/nEunnJZe7_x7JeUT6YG7C7xUSvnJ_InE7SRNTcHn6BcD6BPD3TcHzct7kIal65eyp3RO-XXd2xTBBgICgSQzGWmn4oVlzNlIAYo6v6Xf1kH3Y8DFavAKAPXmhMJvpUVBeF92Wqk3\" style=\"-webkit-transform:rotate(0.00rad); border:none; height:623px; transform:rotate(0.00rad); width:674px\" /></span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">The only inner part is needed, no back/close buttons and no sidebar is needed.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">All the existent features should work like: hide/disable/autoselect conditions, restoring closed form on the same place and so on.</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\"> </span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">When we complete the form and click &ldquo;Submit&rdquo; (rename button &ldquo;Save my project&rdquo; to &ldquo;Submit&rdquo;) the form should be submitted to the URL predefined in the template JSON </span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-family:courier new; font-size:11pt\">submitURL</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\"> property.
