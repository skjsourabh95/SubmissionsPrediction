This needs to be generalized to different question types (i.e. multi-select, single select, yes/no, input text, etc) and to different user journeys. The outcome of this is to create a design system to build the template for various user journeys and a prototype for both mobile and desktop devices.</li>\n\t<li>This form will become a web-application that should be compatible with any device (desktop, tablet or mobile). The form will ask a series of questions to assess the user&rsquo;s financial background, timeline, and eligibility for purchasing a home. The number of &ldquo;questions&rdquo; or data points needed to complete the form can range from 50-100, depending on the complexity of the application. For example, if the user is applying with a co-borrower, twice the information is required for assets, income, and credit history.</li>\n\t<li>In this challenge, you will not be required to include all 100 questions, but instead, you must create a template (form interaction) and style guide for all of the question types, how these questions will be presented dynamically, and how the user will navigate between questions and sections.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Workflow</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>[Out of scope] Banks and real state clients of us will configure surveys, customizing them to their branding and information needs.</li>\n\t<li>[Out of scope] When a potential end-user is ready to apply for a pre-approval, they will receive a link through email or through the client&rsquo;s home page, which will lead them to complete the smart form process.</li>\n\t<li>The final end-user will go through an interactive form filling questions.</li>\n\t<li>There should be a way to authenticate or save users&rsquo; progress.</li>\n\t<li>Once the form is complete, the user receives upfront pre-approval results.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Screens/Features</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#FF8C00\">01. Smart Form Flow (Desktop and Phone)</span>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>For this design exercise, we won&rsquo;t display all the questions but a set of them (unique enough) that allows developers to create pages and components by reusing your design framework (style guide).</li>\n\t<li>This client-facing app needs to handle some sort of authentication mechanism for abandoned sessions (open to suggestions).</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n01.01. Onboarding / Session\n<ul>\n\t<li>The client lands to the app for the first time, what should the user see?</li>\n\t<li>In case a user abandons an on-going session in the middle of question #14, how could she retrieve the latest status? By creating an account mandatory? By creating some authentication mechanism as a first step? What would you suggest considering the flow of the main goal (filling questions) doesn&rsquo;t get interrupted abruptly?</li>\n\t<li>In case it is a returning user from a recovered session, how would you display this scenario?</li>\n\t<li>What is the most natural approach to communicating progress to the user? Is it completion time? Amount of pages? Prev/next buttons?</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n01.02. Form Template\n<ul>\n\t<li>The pre-approval flow should be divided into &ldquo;sections&rdquo; that are grouped by the nature of the questions. Categories:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Timeline</li>\n\t\t<li>Personal Information</li>\n\t\t<li>Desired Property</li>\n\t\t<li>Real Estate</li>\n\t\t<li>Assets&nbsp;</li>\n\t\t<li>Income</li>\n\t\t<li>Credit and Declarations</li>\n\t\t<li>Pre-Approval Results</li>\n\t\t<li><strong>Note:</strong> we expect to see an interaction design for each tab/category.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>A question or data field can have the following types:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Yes/No</li>\n\t\t<li>Input text</li>\n\t\t<li>Could require error validation</li>\n\t\t<li>Different input types:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>Currency</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Percentage</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Address</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Social Security Number</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Phone</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Email</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>Multi-select Dropdown</li>\n\t\t<li>Single-select dropdown (if number of answers &gt;= 5)</li>\n\t\t<li>Single-select buttons&nbsp; (if less than or equal to 4 answers)</li>\n\t\t<li>Checkbox (consent)</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Some questions will only be displayed depending on the answer to the previous question\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>For example, one question asks: Are you applying for this loan with another applicant? (Yes/No question type)&nbsp;</li>\n\t\t<li>If Yes, you need to ask for the following data:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>Co-applicant First Name</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Co-applicant Middle Name</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Co-applicant Last Name</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Co-applicant Email</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>If the user changes his or her answer to from Yes to No, the other co-applicant questions should disappear.&nbsp;</li>\n\t\t<li>See slides 2 and 3 for an example of this :\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oSmqQ9AahjhQiLQ0YOypnELHVPuszsgUX52Te0MLAmM/\">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oSmqQ9AahjhQiLQ0YOypnELHVPuszsgUX52Te0MLAmM/</a></li>\n\t\t\t<li><strong>Note:</strong> use these slides as a means of understanding the requirements; feel free to take the design / visuals in your own direction</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Users should know which section they are currently on, which sections they&rsquo;ve completed, and which sections remain</li>\n\t<li>A user should not be able to navigate to the subsequent section until they have completed all sections prior (see slide 7 for example of this)</li>\n\t<li>The questions within the same section should be revealed vertically as soon as a question is answered; a user should only have to click next or continue in order to start a new section. At the start of a new section, a user should only see one question. The next question is revealed once you answer the previous question. See an example of this here: <a href=\"https://mojomortgages.com\">https://mojomortgages.com</a>/ (click &ldquo;new mortgage&rdquo; to open the calculator).</li>\n\t<li>Questions that you&rsquo;ve answered previously are saved; if you navigate to a previous section, you can review your answers.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>If a user leaves the site, they can log in and are directed through the app to review and edit their submissions.</li>\n\t\t<li>This could be presented in a summary or some kind of expedited view with edit options</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>If you modify your old answer to a question that changes the sequence of required questions, the user is directed to answer these fields\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>For example, if the user changes the answer to &ldquo;Are you working with a real estate agent&rdquo; from &ldquo;No&rdquo; to &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, the next set of questions to get the real estate contact information should be displayed</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>If a section is incomplete or an answer has an error, the error message must be obvious (build this error handling into the design components).</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#FF8C00\">02. Style Guide</span>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The style guide must include a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build this or other form-based interview (question text, headers, and error messages and answers can be mocked).</li>\n\t<li>Create a page (or several) to showcase all the different elements and components contained in the design to be used for development/code guidance purposes.

In this challenge, we are looking to design a scorecard template builder for our Topcoder challenges, which will be used for evaluating the submissions.<br />\n<br />\n<em><strong>Note: in this challenge, you have to use Sketch for design.</strong></em><br />\n<br />\nRead the challenge specification carefully and watch the forums for any questions or feedback concerning this challenge. Let us know if you have any questions in the challenge forum.\n<h3 class='roundLabel'>Round 1</h3><strong>Submit the following designs for the checkpoint deadline:</strong>\n<ol>\n\t<li>Create New Scorecard Template</li>\n\t<li>View Scorecard Template</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 class='roundLabel'>Round 2</h3><strong>Submit the following designs for the final deadline, updated based on checkpoint feedback:</strong>\n<ol>\n\t<li>Create New Scorecard Template</li>\n\t<li>View Scorecard Template</li>\n</ol>\n<br /><strong>Challenge Objectives</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Design the interface for the application</li>\n\t<li>1 screen at 1280px width</li>\n\t<li>Web application</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Project Background</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The purpose of this project is to design a scorecard template builder</li>\n\t<li>The user will be able to customize his template by selecting multiple tools to evaluate a submission</li>\n\t<li>He can assign different weights to each tool</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Workflow</strong><br />\nA scorecard is used to evaluate submissions based on some criteria. For example, for the design track, a scorecard you often see is the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=19yUH21eOSYkC45eYeMSCxMra45CdLp7O\">General Studio Screening Scorecard</a> from Online Review. Other scorecards that we have in Online Review are AV Scorecard, Basic Code Challenge Scorecard, Specification Review Scorecard, etc. who all work in the same way, it&rsquo;s just that they have the scope not to evaluate screening mistakes, but to evaluate the specifications, or submission quality for development or marathon tracks, etc. Right now, we use a single scorecard for a specific purpose, but we would like to change that.<br />\n<br />\nIn the new model, a user will be able to use an existing review type or create his own scorecard template, from a collection of existing review types. You can see <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iiE3aocQVjswy1JraM3eEeSZZ-hIv_yS\">a screenshot</a> of how we envision this. The example is shown for development evaluating submissions on the development track. &nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nNote: the screenshot should be used just as reference. DO NOT COPY IT! We are looking for your original ideas on the best user experience would be.<br />\n<br />\nThe user can select from the left side one of the existing review types: SonarQube, Checkmarx, Community, External or he can create his own scorecard template on these review types. On this challenge, we are focusing on the creation of the Scorecard Template Builder. Once the user has created it, he will be able to see it as non-editable.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Users</strong><br />\nThe users of this application are\n<ul>\n\t<li>Copilots</li>\n\t<li>Challenge architects</li>\n\t<li>Customers</li>\n</ul>\nThey will create select the different review types at the beginning of the challenge for different phases: specifications review, screening review, submissions review, etc.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Screens Requirements:</strong><br />\n<strong>1. Create </strong><strong>New</strong><strong> Scorecard Template</strong>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">On this page the user is able to:<br />\n<strong>a.</strong><strong> See</strong><strong> the existing review types:</strong> SonarQube, Checkmarx, Blackduck etc. and select one to go with &ndash; Custom one in this case. Please keep in mind when planning the navigation, that we will have many tools/review types listed, so think of a good way to show them all. Some of the tools will be used for specific track mostly so you could label them to show that (Design, Prototype, Code, Marathon Match, QA).<br />\n<strong>b. Add a general description</strong> for the scorecard template (what you see in the example as the &ldquo;Custom Scorer: This reviewer is your own docker image that will provide a code review score when it receives a submission&rdquo;<br />\n<strong>c. Add a link where the custom scorecard template will reside</strong> &ndash; like the dockerhub link in the image<br />\n<strong>d</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> Check</strong><strong> a couple of options about showing the results</strong> to the submitter, to the other competitors and when</div>\n<br />\nOnce the general infos have been completed, comes the most important part: the scorecard template builder (the table you see on the right side of screenshot) which is build of a collection of review types.. Initially, this table will be empty and there will be an option / button/ link, etc. to add a new tool. The table can be represented as a list or any other way you see fit, but it should include the following fields:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Review type</li>\n\t<li>Order</li>\n\t<li>Weight</li>\n\t<li>Mandatory</li>\n\t<li>Event</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>User Scenario</strong><br />\n<u>Step 1: </u>The scorecard template is empty<br />\n<u>Step 2:</u> The copilot adds the first review type. This can be done using a popup, flyover menu or inside the table. When adding a review type all the 5 items from above should be included: tool name, order, weight, mandatory, event.&nbsp; Since we will have many tools, they can be grouped or labeled by track, but the user should still be able to select different tools from different tracks as well.<br />\n<u>Step 3:</u> The scorecard template gets filled with customized review types (we would just like to see multiple entries listed inside)<br />\n<u>Step 4: </u>The user validates the scorecard: when adding multiple review types, the sum of the weights for those tools should be 100%. The user should have an option to validate this and show an error if that&rsquo;s the case.<br />\n<u>Step 5</u>: the user saves the new scorecard template and the entire page will be shown in view mode.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>2. View Scorecard Template</strong><br />\nThis page is a non-editable version of the page that was just created before. The user has the option to edit it, so this way he will go back to the previous step.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Note</strong>: we are looking for your ideas and creativity on how the custom scorecard should work. <strong>Do not copy the provided screenshot.</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Key Items to Focus on</strong><br />\n- This web application must look in brand with the current Topcoder community site.<br />\n- Create an intuitive user experience for the copilots<br />\n- Target desktop web devices with a minimum resolution of 1280px width and height can be increased if needed.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Branding</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Colors: is mandatory you follow the exact Topcoder colors from the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1otRJWvzm6syL0DeYtHkCPlUtVRnzh5G7\">GUI KIT</a></li>\n\t<li>Fonts: use <a href=\"https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/roboto\">Roboto</a> font as that is the standard font we are using for the new Topcoder site and have the text only in the TC colors (shades of gray).</li>\n\t<li>Use the <strong>new navigation</strong> we have that is provided in the GUI KIT</li>\n\t<li>If there is something else you need or have questions, ask in the forums.</li>\n\t<li>Stock photos and stock icons are allowed from the approved sources.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Target Audience</strong><br />\nTopcoder copilots, challenge architects and customers.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Judging Criteria</strong><br />\nYour submission will be judged by:\n<ul>\n\t<li>How appealing does the user interface looks ?</li>\n\t<li>How easy is to read the scorecard template information?</li>\n\t<li>Is the design consistent and follows the GUI designs?</li>\n\t<li>Hierarchy and organization of content</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Marvel Prototype</strong><br />\n- Request a Marvel Prototype on forums or email keyla.blue1@gmail.com<br />\n- Provide clickable spots (hotzones) to link your screens and show the interactivity.<br />\n- We need you to upload your screens to Marvel App.<br />\n- You MUST include your Marvel App URL on your notes during submission upload (in your Marvel App prototype, click on share and then copy that

In this challenge, our customer is looking for a unique and engaging design concept that helps their existing and potential financial customers make better and informed decisions.<br />\n<br />\nRead the challenge specification carefully and watch the forums for any questions or feedback concerning this challenge.

To help their customers understand and learn more about finance, tax savings and investments, they are looking to create a more engaging &quot;educational experience&quot; that will allow a customer the ability to learn and self-service themselves quickly.<br />\n<br />\nThe goal of this design concepts challenge is to design the &quot;financial education&quot; application focused on creating a new, fun, and engaging user experience. We want to explore new ways of engaging our customers to take the time to learn about their financial future through modern techniques like gamification, recommendation and reward systems, teaching modules, etc. In the end, our customer would like to see an increase in engagement with this tool from their financial customer base.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Users</strong><br />\nThis application would be used by anyone who wants to learn or get ideas about financial management. The user could be an existing customer who enrolled in 401K plans or a new customer who is looking to learn more about finance and their retirement options. Our users could be of any age group, any gender or level of knowledge. Consider this audience while you design the solution.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Screens Requirements</strong><br />\nFor this challenge, we are not providing exact screen requirements. You are free to design as many as you like as long as your screens are in line with the flow since this is a design concepts challenge.<br />\n&nbsp;\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\"><strong>1. Onboarding (Desktop)</strong><br />\nThe application would onboard customers. The app would capture some initial information about the customer, like interests, financial situation, etc, based on the responses then the app would be able to target them better with customized learning module recommendations. The user is able to change their interests later.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>2. Landing Page (Desktop + Phone)</strong><br />\nThe landing page would show the user their progress within the app, the latest/recommended learning modules, badges, achievements, notifications or even discussions from other users on the topics they are interested in. What other concepts, priorities might be useful to show on their dashboard?<br />\n<br />\n<strong>3. Financial Education Topics List (Desktop + Phone)</strong><br />\nDesign an interesting way to browse the education catalog of the app. Supply a way to search the catalog with filters etc. Show sample topics related to finance, investment or tax savings. What would be the more interesting metrics to show about a learning module to make it more desirable (key learnings, duration, points to earn, badges to get, achievements to acquire). Could the application recommend next steps or additional training based on what a user has already completed?<br />\n<br />\n<strong>4. Financial Education Topics Details (Desktop)</strong><br />\nThis is where the actual learning modules/phases take place. We are interested in how you show the content/module. The user experience should not feel like reading a word/pdf file. Our ask is to make it more interactive and engaging (if possible). The experience might show estimated time to complete, help, share, recommended modules after completion. The content could be a combination of reading and video. We are open to your suggestions - we recommend doing your research in this space.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>5. My Profile (Desktop)</strong><br />\nThe user should be able to see his/her progress in detail. Are there different user levels (e.g. newbie, regular, pro = tied to financial terminology)? What achievements has the user accomplished? What are the next badges he/she can get? Do not feel limited by these ideas, we are open to your suggestions.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>6. Leaderboard/Rewards/Discussions/Quiz (Desktop)</strong><br />\nWhich of the above could help customer engagement the best? Experiment with the different approaches or include them all.</div>\n\n<ul style=\"margin-left:40px\">\n\t<li>Leaderboard: Let the user see overall where he/she stands compared to other members. Who is a member of the week?</li>\n\t<li>Rewards: Any offers/coupons/rewards once they complete the module?</li>\n\t<li>Discussions: To make the experience more engaging you might experiment with some social features. Let the users discuss the topics/modules. You could also include subject matter experts in the discussions.</li>\n\t<li>Quiz: A Popup quiz from the topics they completed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\"><br />\n<strong>7. Sign In (Desktop)</strong><br />\nWe are looking to include a sign-in screen where existing customers can log into the app with their email address and password. Keep link to user registration and forgot password options. Show some error validation in this screen. Note: This is not a priority screen.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>8. Other Screen(s) (Desktop)</strong><br />\nAny other screen/concepts for this application? This is a design concepts challenge&hellip; this is the space where you can shine/showcase your thoughts.</div>\n<br />\n<strong>Target Device</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Desktop 1366px width and height as required</li>\n\t<li>Responsive Phone 750px width and height as required</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Branding Guidelines</strong><br />\nPlease consider the below guidelines during your design

This currently uses Firebase for Fulfillment. We will share this in the contest forum.</p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Individual requirements</strong></p>\n\n<p><u>Create an Azure Logic App based task (Major Requirement)</u></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>We will be storing a file in Azure File. The file will be in excel format and contain only one worksheet. There will only be one file, that gets replaced with a new file (containing new data) periodically (or think of it as the data in the same file keeps getting updated periodically).</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The Azure Logic App will invoke an Azure Function that reads the new file, processes it, and uploads the data to Cosmos DB using Mongodb API. The invocation will happen at an interval that needs to be configurable.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>We will only have one model named Users. Each column in the excel file will represent an attribute of the model in Cosmos DB. Additionally, there will be an attribute named &ldquo;isRegistered&rdquo; for each document in the database. This attribute will make sense later below, when we describe the DialogFlow Fulfillment.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Note that there could already be data in the database (from earlier executions). The Azure Function is expected to perform an upsert operation using the email address (the first column in the excel) as the key field. No existing data will be deleted.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Also note that during the update operation, the value of isRegistered attribute will not be touched. That is, for documents that are being updated, the update operation will NEVER update the isRegistered attribute. For new documents being inserted, the isRegistered column will be false.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The only constant fields will be the email address and isRegistered. Other columns in the excel may or may not exist. Accordingly define the schema for the User model.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><u>Create an Azure Function for DialogFlow Fulfillment (Major Requirement)</u></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Currently, we have an Action on Google using the DialogFlow based workflow, where the Fulfillment is hosted on Firebase.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Replace this with a webhook, that invokes an Azure Function. This means you will need to update the deployment guide of the Action on Google module to instruct the steps to carry this out.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The Fulfillment code that exists currently needs to be migrated over to the Azure Function.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Currently, the Fulfillment code uses a variable (named users), that holds a bunch of users, to act as the mock &ldquo;database&rdquo;. Replace this to instead interface with Cosmos DB that will hold the data. Use Mongodb API with Cosmos DB. You don&rsquo;t have to copy the data over - that will be done through the earlier requirement.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The Cosmos DB used here, is the same database that is used in the earlier requirement, where we update the database periodically with new data. The data structure of the mock database contains email address and isRegistered fields, just like the data structure of the data stored in Cosmos DB.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>So, essentially, what is happening here is that we are migrating the code from Firebase over to Azure Function and using a real database instead of a mock one. And finally, we are using this for the webhook based Fulfillment. Everything else should work as before.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Deployment guide</strong></p>\n\n<p>Treat the Azure based services as a separate module, with its own deployment guide. The deployment guide should be detailed - the assumption that you can make here are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>That we have an active Azure account</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>That we know how to use a command line interface</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>That we know how to use the Azure portal</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thus, your deployment guide should be really detailed in describing how to set up the various services, either through the CLI or through the GUI. Screenshots are optional, but highly recommended.</p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p>You can submit either a markdown file or a Word document file. Kindly do not submit only PDF files, because we cannot edit them later.</p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Important Notes</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>You need to update the Fulfillment code to ensure that it executes inside an Azure Function. That is acceptable as long as you do not modify the conversation workflow and as long as the updates are only to ensure that the Fulfillment code executes correctly inside Azure Functions.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>No updates are expected to the Action on Google module, besides updates to the Deployment Guide, where you will mention that we need to use the webhook, and also mention that we need to specify the Azure function&rsquo;s endpoint for use in the webhook. (Describe how to retrieve the endpoint details)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The source code that you will migrate to Azure Function - lint the code using <a href=\"https://standardjs.com/\">standard</a> lint.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Treat the assets relevant for this contest (other the deployment guide for Action on Google) as an independent module. Thus, we will end up with two modules - one for the Action on Google and one for the Azure Services. Although they are related, we intend to treat them as modules of their own.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"color:#FF0000\">Your Fulfillment code will NOT make any use of Firebase functions.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<br /><br /><h2>Final Submission Guidelines</h2><p>Zip the assets for the Azure Services along with the deployment guide. Take this zip file and along with the Deployment Guide for the Action on Google, create another zip file and upload this one to Topcoder. You are not required to upload the Action on Google module.</p>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n","descriptionFormat":"HTML","projectId":11033,"created":"2019-06-14T08:24:44Z","createdBy":"callmekatootie","updated":"2019-06-20T21:50:24Z","updatedBy":"AutoPilot","timelineTemplateId":"4df06ca4-367f-4768-93b4-94ba18625983","phases":[{"id":"74ee245d-ea51-4360-985c-57439d1c9157","name":"Registration","phaseId":"a93544bc-c165-4af4-b55e-18f3593b457a","duration":345600,"scheduledStartDate":"2019-06-14T08:36:54Z","scheduledEndDate":"2019-06-18T08:47:37Z","actualStartDate":"2019-06-14T08:36:54Z","actualEndDate":"2019-06-18T08:47:37Z","isOpen":false},{"id":"2a53ca00-f0c4-402e-bdef-72e78a50a29b","name":"Submission","phaseId":"6950164f-3c5e-4bdc-abc8-22aaf5a1bd49","duration":345300,"scheduledStartDate":"2019-06-14T08:51:00Z","scheduledEndDate":"2019-06-18T11:54:42Z","actualStartDate":"2019-06-14T08:51:00Z","actualEndDate":"2019-06-18T11:54:42Z","isOpen":false},{"id":"ad55ac77-fbc5-4c11-8c97-eda542b69806","name":"Review","phaseId":"aa5a3f78-79e0-4bf7-93ff-b11e8f5b398b","duration":172800,"scheduledStartDate":"2019-06-18T08:48:19Z","scheduledEndDate":"2019-06-20T07:21:58Z","actualStartDate":"2019-06-18T08:48:19Z","actualEndDate":"2019-06-20T07:21:58Z","isOpen":false},{"id":"6602473c-0a18-4c2e-945c-31664c985e1c","name":"Appeals","phaseId":"1c24cfb3-5b0a-4dbd-b6bd-4b0dff5349c6","duration":86400,"scheduledStartDate":"2019-06-20T07:22:26Z","scheduledEndDate":"2019-06-20T21:07:58Z","actualStartDate":"2019-06-20T07:22:26Z","actualEndDate":"2019-06-20T21:07:58Z","isOpen":false},{"id":"5acb02ee-9458-41d9-9fe8-45623ed35026","name":"Appeals

Market data comes from a 3rd party vendor (available securities, prices, indexes, etc). App doesn&rsquo;t manage users, but integrates with partner websites (ex user is redirected to the app from the partner website/app) and the current user portfolio is not managed by the app - it is queried from the partner API(s). Once the user confirms suggested trades list, it is forwarded to the partner using their API.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Admin users can configure various settings that affect portfolio optimization and user inputs.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">All user actions will be audited (both on API level and the app actions - clicks) and this data will be available in various reports.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">App will create various notifications for the users - ex securities price changes, executed trades, etc</span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Individual requirements</strong></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">We&rsquo;re aiming to create three things in this challenge:</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Data model (ER diagram)</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">REST API specification document (swagger)</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Screen API calls mapping - a document detailing which API endpoints should be called on each screen</span></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Input data</span><br />\n\t<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">There are 4 types of data that will be imported to the system.

For now we can assume the redirect will contain a &ldquo;token&rdquo; field that our app can use to call the partner website and get the user info (user id, first/last name). This info should be stored to the app database and a JWT token would be returned to the user to use for all other API calls.</span><br />\n\t<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Upon authentication, the backend will query the user portfolio (list of securities ticker / market code and number of shares) from the partner website and store it in the database (overwriting any previous user portfolio data). See the sample portfolio data in the TestPortfolio sheet in the provided dataset.</span><br />\n\t<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Note that the app will support multiple partner websites so the partner identifier should be stored in the user info as well - partner list can be a fixed enumerated list for now.</span><br />\n\t<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Admin users will be authenticated with email/password combination and the admin users list will be managed by the app (we need CRUD API for admin users) and the login flow for the admin users should be completely separate from the regular app users (admin users can&rsquo;t use the app and vice versa)</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Factor configuration</span><br />\n\t<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Factors list is configured by admin users in a separate admin portal page.

Generate ideas module has two views - showing all securities, or showing just the securities in any of the four quadrants (value=50 for each axis is the center point), and the number of &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; returned by the api should be limited (setting in the admin portal)</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Adjust portfolio</span><br />\n\t<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">This feature allows the user to update the desired securities list and their weights in the portfolio. It should be saved to the user portfolio data in the database (it is used for portfolio optimization and is not sent to the partner site).</span><br />\n\t<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">The app will track 3 types of portfolios for each user: Current (loaded from the partner API), Revised (modifications done to the Current portfolio by the user) and Optimized (optimized version of the last Revised portfolio). </span><br />\n\t<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Current portfolio won&rsquo;t change during the user session, it&rsquo;s only updated when logging out and back in.</span><br />\n\t<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Revised portfolio keeps all the modifications to the previous portfolio - we need to keep history of the Revised portfolio as the app has Undo/Redo options to show the previous portfolio versions. </span><br />\n\t<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Optimized portfolio is the optimized version of a Revised portfolio (or Current portfolio if the user didn&rsquo;t make any changes). We can consider optimized portfolio as yet another version of a Revised portfolio. </span><br />\n\t<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">It is up to you to decide how to store the portfolio versions in the db (separate collections, or one collection with &lsquo;type&rsquo; flags), but the app will need to get complete portfolio history and add new versions of Revised/Optimized/Current portfolio.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Portfolio optimization</span><br />\n\t<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Portfolio is optimized based on user inputs - desired volatility level and expected return. See the &ldquo;Result&rdquo; sheet in the provided dataset for the outputs of the portfolio optimization that needs to be stored. Optimization is an asynchronous process so we need to provide API endpoints to query the optimization status.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Trade</span><br />\n\t<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">List of securities to trade is provided by the optimization module and can be modified by the user. Confirming the trade will forward the trade list to the partner website and store the information to the app database. Note that we do need to store trade status - trades aren&rsquo;t instantaneous so the status should support multiple states ex trade pending, sent to partner, error sending to partner, trade failed, trade completed and trade status changes should be audited.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Reporting</span><br />\n\t<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Reporting endpoints will provide 3 reports with filtering options</span></p>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Securities history (trades list) - filtering by dates, ticker name, amount range, buy/sell, country, market, asset class</span></p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;

font-size:11pt\">Auditing</span><br />\n\t<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">All the user actions (api calls) should be audited into a database table</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Notifications</span><br />\n\t<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">User notifications will be generated asynchronously (ex during data import, executing trades list, etc) - create the notifications listing endpoint.</span><br />\n\t<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Admin users will have the option to configure rules for creating notifications, ex &ldquo;percentile ranking of a stock in user portfolio has changed over a threshold&rdquo; or &ldquo;price of a stock in user portfolio has changed over a threshold&rdquo; and those thresholds should be configured in the portal and saved to the database.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Lookup data</span><br />\n\t<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Create lookup endpoints for common app data used in the screens (ex securities, countries, markets, asset classes, etc)</span></p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Make sure to design the data model with sufficient details to track all the relations required for the calculations (ex ticker name can be used as identifier for a security, user_id would identify the user, etc).&nbsp;</span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>General for all requirements</strong></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Use camelCase for all JSON and data model attribute names, TitleCase for entity/table names.&nbsp; Pick names that are short yet descriptive and unambiguous.</span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>What To Submit</strong></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;

Previously we ran a <a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/challenges/30091715/?type=design&amp;noncache=true\">successful challenge</a> to create the mobile version for our responsive CMS Demonstration website using the Mobile First approach. We are now continuing with a follow-up challenge to create the best possible UI/UX for our Desktop/Web part using our mobile design as references.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThis &#39;Demonstration Site&#39; will appear by default whenever our user installed our CMS (Content Management System) for the first time so the site doesn&#39;t look empty since it has no content yet. The site also need to be able to feature all our CMS capability.<br />\n<br />\nRead the challenge specification carefully and watch the forums for any questions or feedback concerning this challenge. Let us know if you have any questions in the challenge forum!\n<h3 class='roundLabel'>Round 1</h3><strong>Submit your initial design as much as possible for a Checkpoint Feedback</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>As part of your checkpoint submission, you must upload your submission to MarvelApp so we can provide direct feedback on your designs. Please include the MarvelApp URL in your notes.txt.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Make sure all pages have the correct flow. Use the proper file numbers, (1, 2, 3, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class='roundLabel'>Round 2</h3><strong>Submit your Final Design (All requirements) plus Checkpoint Updates</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>As part of your Final submission, you must replace your checkpoint submission with the final submission into MarvelApp so we can provide direct feedback on your designs. Please include the MarvelApp URL in your notes.txt.</li>\n\t<li>Make sure all pages have the correct flow. Use the proper file numbers, (1, 2, 3, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<br /><span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><u><strong>BACKGROUND OVERVIEW</strong></u></span>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Our content management system (CMS) needs to have a new &#39;Demonstration Site&#39; that we will supply with the product</li>\n\t<li>The &#39;Demonstration Site&#39; is a small website whose purpose is to ensure that the CMS is not empty when it is first installed</li>\n\t<li>The &#39;Demonstration Site&#39; will be used to demonstrate the CMS capabilities and will be expanded over time</li>\n\t<li>The &#39;Demonstration Site&#39; should beautiful and engaging</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><u><strong>CHALLENGE GOAL</strong></u></span>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Create the best possible UI/UX for the Desktop/Web version of our CMS&nbsp; &#39;Demonstration Site&#39; based on the Mobile design version while still maintaining the level of design consistency at the maximum level.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><u><strong>CMS CAPABILITIES</strong></u></span>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>As noted above, the demonstration site will eventually be implemented in our Content Management System to showcase its capabilities. This challenge is strictly focussed on the design of the reference site, but for reference here is a little information about the CMS used.</li>\n\t<li>The CMS is able to build websites and manage content for use in both web and non-web channels. It can integrate applications and produce sites whose content and navigation are role based. The CMS can also detect device types and adapt the content served based on this, beyond any in-browser adaptation done through responsive design.</li>\n\t<li>When we implement the demonstration site, we will add our in-line editing and site management tools, as well as applying role or device based controls to some parts of the site.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><u><strong>DESIGN CONSIDERATION</strong></u></span>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Innovative and Beautiful designs for this demonstration site, to be followed by implementation</li>\n\t<li>Consistency between Mobile and Web/Desktop version needs to be the same&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Best Practice for Responsive Web (we are going to focus on Desktop/Web device in this challenge)</li>\n\t<li>The imagery used must be obtainable under a royalty-free license that will allow us to distribute it with the sample site (Pexel, Unsplash is preferable)</li>\n\t<li>Consideration should be given to choosing imagery that will be acceptable worldwide. Where people are represented in the images, a diverse range of ethnicities and genders should be shown</li>\n\t<li>For this challenge, you do not need to write realistic body text. Lorem Ipsum is acceptable.</li>\n\t<li>Make sure the site design you create is consistent - so if you choose to create a minimalist look (for example), make sure that this is reflected in your choice of colors, images and so on. You may choose whether to emphasize ceramics, lighting or other furnishings, and whether to leverage the Studio&#39;s hometown in your design somehow</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><u><strong>CHALLENGE FORUM</strong></u></span>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>If you have any doubts or questions regarding challenge requirements, please ask in our challenge forum:</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=ThreadList&amp;forumID=681921\">https://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=ThreadList&amp;forumID=681921</a></li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><u><strong>DEMONSTRATION SITE REQUIREMENTS</strong></u></span><br />\nThe &#39;Demonstration site&#39; will represent a small, fictional company called &quot;Woodburn Studio&quot; and The brief for the content of the site is below.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Woodburn Studio - company overview</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>&quot;Woodburn Studio&quot; is a fictional organization that exists only for the site demonstration purposes</li>\n\t<li>Woodburn Studio is a small high-end design studio that designs home furnishings such as ceramics and lighting (NOTE: this is selected because of the possibility for beautiful but fairly culturally neutral imagery)</li>\n\t<li>Its work is exhibited and sold in leading boutiques and galleries, and the Studio accepts custom commissions too.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>They are based in Edinburgh, Scotland but their work is sold around the world. (NOTE: this information is provided in case any locale specific content is needed)</li>\n\t<li>The Studio is a small organization, with a couple of permanent designers and a variable number of others who share their space.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Woodburn Studio - Site brief</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Since the Studio sells through galleries and boutiques, no eCommerce capability is required at this time (NOTE: We may add it in a future evolution). The site is mostly about presenting the Studio&#39;s brand and so it can be very simple</li>\n\t<li>The site should showcase their recent creations, highlight where their work is available, explain their design philosophy and make it possible for them to receive commissions</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Woodburn Studio - Site Functionality</strong><br />\n<strong>00) General Requirements</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Please make sure all content from the mobile design exist in your Desktop/Web design</li>\n\t<li>Make sure the navigation available in the desktop/web (reference 08_Menu_A@2x.png - 08_Menu_B@2x.png)</li>\n\t<li>Need to have a search feature in the demo site (reference 09_Search_A@2x.png - 09_Search_B@2x.png)</li>\n\t<li>Utilize the fix section feature where each content section fit into user screen so we can minimize scrolling (reference 10_Fit_Page_A@2x.png - 10_Fit_Page_H@2x.png)&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>01) Homepage Screen</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Refer to <em>01_Homepage_A@2x.png - 01_Homepage_D@2x.png</em></li>\n\t<li>Website visitors will find the homepage first.

time.&nbsp; Perfection preferred, not necessary.<br />\n<br />\nIn brief, the user story is:<br />\nThe user is a field maintenance worker who climbs ladders and fixes old equipment.&nbsp; We want to boost the safety of the user by telling them the best way to use the ladder, and then, give them AR access to a field manual for fixing the equipment.&nbsp; A grown-up version of this would even let the user see a pic-by-pic process of fixing the equipment (but, we don&#39;t need that today).<br />\n<br />\n1. The user opens the app on his or her phone<br />\n2. Points the phone at the field<br />\n3. Phone recognizes a ladder (of any kind - your choice)<br />\n4. Phone produces an overlay that looks kind of cool and tells the user how to use the ladder.&nbsp; Don&#39;t totally cover the field of view, its ok for it to be a couple sentences and a URL to more instructions.<br />\n4.a. Even better; user can touch the instructions in 4 and interact with them.&nbsp; This is a nice-to-have, not a must-have.<br />\n<br />\nAs the user pans around, the overlay stays fixed to the object of interest.<br />\n<br />\n5.

Note the very short deadline.&nbsp; Apps need to get up to #4 to be considered.<br />\n&nbsp;<br /><br /><h2>Final Submission Guidelines</h2><strong>Please submit the following:</strong><br />\n- A writeup of your app, in .doc or .pdf, that includes screen shots of your app<br />\n- Or, alternatively, a recording of your app in motion.&nbsp;

Note that, in the sample data provided, all fields referring to names of companies/clients, the real names have been replaced with dummy values to protect the anonymity of the data.</span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:proxima nova,sans-serif; font-size:12pt\">Both the dataset and the winning solution can be found in the forum.

For each row, the Z-score solution can produce a range of reasonable costs and then determine whether it is an outlier. It is now designed to run on the full dataset.</span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:proxima nova,sans-serif; font-size:12pt\">In the end of this challenge, we would like to fit the Z-score solution as the backend of the following 2 outputs. </span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:12pt\">Specifically, a CSV output file, where the user can filter for &ldquo;Market&rdquo;, &ldquo;Region&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Activity&rdquo; and see the reasonable cost range (i.e., upper limit and lower limit). Below is a UI that can help illustrate the request. Note that the UI need not be built, just the information needs to be available in a CSV output. Also, this output should be for all Regions, markets and Activities; NOT just the outliers.

The benefit has a hard coded question, and then several types of available answers to round out the question. &nbsp;For example, a question might be &ldquo;Is this is High Deductible Health Plan?&rdquo; and the user might have a choice of 2 check boxes, radio buttons, or a drop down with Yes/No toggles. The answer then becomes the statement combination of the Q&amp;A, leaving &ldquo;No, this is not a high deductible health plan.&rdquo; &nbsp;Another examples the Question might be &ldquo;The out of pocket maximum is:&rdquo; and the user enters &ldquo;$3000&rdquo;, leaving the answer to be &ldquo;The OPM is $3000.&rdquo; Or finally the Answer might be &ldquo;Enter additional comments here&rdquo; in which the user might enter free form text and that free form text becomes the answer. &nbsp;These sets of answers are rolled up to a form all of the benefits for a specific coverage code.</span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The actual data set contains flat data records that:</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">List the benefits (the answer column) and question identifiers (sequence_id)</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Connect benefits to coverage codes</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Connect coverage codes to internal products</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Start/End date for the coverage</span></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">And also these useful columns:</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Type_of_tag - information about the type of field presented in the software - radio button, checkbox, text input, dropdown</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Value flag - this is only populated for records where type of tag is text - It denotes whether the user entry field is a text field (meaning all open free form text allowed) or it is a numeric field, meaning the answer may contain some text that is automatically generated by the software, but the user can only enter a numeric value.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Top50_flag - This just denotes that the coverage code is for a very important client</span></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Technology Stack</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Python</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Excel</span></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Code access</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">We have attached the two winning submissions that you are to combine in the Resources post in Forums.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Winning submission of the ideation challenge is also available in the forums - it contains the details of what we&rsquo;re trying to build in this project.

If you successfully complete multiple sets of test cases, then you will be awarded a prize for each one completed.</li>\n\t<li>If you execute a test case and miss an issue that is found by the reviewer, then you are on risk losing payment for that test case.

If you really need to edit an issue you must use the comments section for this (i.e. add a comment to describe any changes you want to make to the issue), and we&#39;ll decide whether the changes are major enough to move the issue to the end of the queue.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>You must specify the test data you have used in the &#39;Reproduction Steps&#39;, All the issues will be marked as &#39;Incomplete&#39;, if the correct test data is not provided.</li>\n\t<li>There will be no appeals phase. The decision of PM/co-pilot for validity and severity of each filed issue will be final.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Issue Weight and Scoring:</h4>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Scoring will be based on the number of bugs by weight. Be sure to correctly attach a weight to your bug.</li>\n\t<li>The review team has the right to change a issue category, priority and severity at their discretion.</li>\n\t<li>Only verified issues by reviewer and accepted by client will be counted. Duplicate issues will be closed and not counted.</li>\n\t<li>Log issues according to the guidelines above. Issues that do not follow these guidelines may reject due to lack of information.</li>\n\t<li>For challenge scoring, the user with the most verified issues/points will be selected as the winner.

The &ldquo;Wrapper&rdquo; will be a nodejs module that will be used instead of directly making HTTP calls to the submission api.

The scorecard has dedicated sections for deployment guide and tests and reviewer will use these sections (and not major requirements section) to score issues related to deployment guide and tests</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The documentation and tests will be very similar to the documentation of the bus api wrapper, where the user can view the list of exposed methods, their usage etc.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Deployment guide and validation document</strong></p>\n\n<p>You are creating a nodejs module.

Ensure there are no lint errors in your submission.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Typescript is not allowed. No build or compilation of code expected.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Use mocha and chai for testing.

requirements</strong></p>\n\n<p><u>Write Swagger based specification for an api (Major requirement)</u></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>There will be two resources in scope for this contest: Score System and Scorecard. The schema for these two will be shared in the contest forum.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>You need to follow the v5 standards document that we will share with you in the contest forum. These standards describe how we need to model our resources and endpoints.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>For reference purposes, you can also refer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/topcoder-platform/submissions-api/blob/develop/docs/swagger.yaml\">submission api</a>, which is also based off the v5 standards. However, note that while submission api uses generators, you need to use async await pattern.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>You need to create the swagger based specification for CRUD and HEAD based endpoints for the two resources</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>You don&rsquo;t have to support pagination for any endpoint. No headers or query parameters or validation expected here. If the api client does provide one in their request, we ignore it.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><u>Implement the endpoints in Nodejs (Major requirement)</u></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>After writing the specification, proceed to implement them in Nodejs.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Use <a href=\"https://expressjs.com/\">Express js</a> as your server framework.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Implement all the endpoints to match the specification defined in Swagger.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Use Dynamodb as your database.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The endpoints will have a prefix of &ldquo;/v5&rdquo;. Score System will come under &ldquo;/v5/scoreSystems&rdquo; and &ldquo;/v5/scorecards&rdquo;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>For the search using query parameters implementation, you can read all the data from Dynamodb and search during runtime in the code itself instead of using CONTAINS operator. This is only for Score System resource. For scorecard resource, you need to perform case sensitive search in Dynamodb (user cannot search scorecardDetails attribute)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>For the Scorecard endpoints, when returning the scorecard details, you need to also return the name attribute using the Score System ids. <u>This is a minor requirement.</u></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Deployment guide and validation document</strong></p>\n\n<p>Create a deployment guide using markdown.

Ensure there are no lint errors and create a npm script to allow us to run the linter.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>You need to provide unit tests and end to end tests using mocha and chai for all the endpoints. Reviewers will consider the section in the scorecard dedicated for tests and not consider this in the Major Requirements section. Test coverage needs to be more than 80%.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>���Each endpoint requires authorization. Follow the same logic <a href=\"https://github.com/topcoder-platform/submissions-api/blob/develop/app.js#L85\">as used by the submission api</a> in securing the endpoints. You do not have to worry about which users are allowed access - <a href=\"https://github.com/topcoder-platform/submissions-api/blob/develop/src/routes/SubmissionRoutes.js#L11\">Topcoder User or Copilot roles or scopes</a> or something similar as long as you make provisions to allow us to update them.

Library Config Service","description":"<span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>CHALLENGE REQUIREMENTS</strong></span><br />\nWe are building a configuration provider (micro) service. This service will consist of two components described below:<br />\n(<em><strong>***Note: please register to download the full spec with screenshots from the forum.)</strong></em><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Configuration Provider Microservice (called CPM)</strong><br />\nThis service consumes a configuration file (JSON) and provides the possibility for other microservices to register themselves in order to retrieve configuration changes. Upon changes, the registered microservices will get informed about the configuration changes by calling an API that is provided by the consuming microservices via the CCNM.<br />\nThe CPM also provides an API endpoint which can be used by consuming microservices to get configuration upon their initial launch or when informed about a change.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Configuration Consumer Node Module (called CCNM)</strong><br />\nThis node module will be used by all microservices that want to consume the configuration provided by the CPM. This module exposes an API endpoint on which the CPM is able to inform the consuming microservice about changes and retrieves the configuration from the CPM. It also manages the registration and deregistration of the consuming microservice at the CPM.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Configuration File Description</strong><br />\nThis file is a JSON file that will be consumed by the CPM. It contains the configuration for all our other microservices. It also contains the configuration for the CPM and CCNM (described as &ldquo;configuration-provider&rdquo;)<br />\n<br />\nExample Schema:<br />\n{<br />\n&nbsp; &quot;configuration-provider&quot;: {<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;registration-interval&quot;: 60<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;cleanup-threshold&quot;: 120<br />\n&nbsp; },<br />\n&nbsp; &quot;microservice-number-one&quot;: {<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;parameter-one&quot;: &quot;value&quot;,<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;parameter-two &quot;: &quot;value&quot;<br />\n&nbsp; },<br />\n&nbsp; &quot;microservice-number-two&quot;: {<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;parameter-one&quot;: &quot;value&quot;,<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;parameter-two &quot;: &quot;value&quot;<br />\n&nbsp; }<br />\n}<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Consumer Registration Directory Description</strong><br />\nThis directory contains a lockfile for each consuming microservice that has registered itself at the CPM. A typical consuming microservice lock file has the following name and contains information about the endpoint provided by the CCNM.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nExample Lockfile Name:<br />\nmicroservice-number-one.&lt;host&gt;.&lt;registration-timestamp&gt;<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nThe lockfiles are created by the CPM when a consuming microservice is being registered. The timestamp in the filename defines, when the consuming microservice has been registered last time.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nA consuming microservice has to re-register itself in a certain interval. The timestamp of the lockfile will be update on re-registration.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nThe lockfiles are removed when either a consuming microservice is deregistering itself, when the timestamp of a lockfile is older than a certain threshold (set by &ldquo;cleanup-threshold&rdquo; in configuration).<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Configuration Provider Microservice Description</strong><br />\nThe CPM REST API listens on port 80 (port should be configurable).<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nThe CPM is providing a REST API to retrieve the configuration for consuming microservices with the following endpoint:\n<ul>\n\t<li>GET&nbsp;/configuration\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Parameters:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>service: name of calling consumer microservice</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>Return:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>configuration as JSON, this will return the whole configuration regardless of the service name.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\nThe CPM is providing an API to register and deregister consuming microservices with the following endpoints:\n<ul>\n\t<li>POST /consumers/register\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Parameters:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>service: name of calling consumer microservice</li>\n\t\t\t<li>host: hostname or ip of consuming microservice</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>Return:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>JSON Response with configured registration-interval</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>POST /consumers/deregister\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Parameters:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>service: name of calling consumer microservice</li>\n\t\t\t<li>host: hostname or ip of consuming microservice</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>Return\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>200 OK</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\nEach microservice that wants to consume the configuration needs to register itself in order to get informed about updates.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nThe CPM will create a lockfile in a directory for each consuming microservice that registers itself. The structure of a lockfile is described in &ldquo;Consumer Registration Directory Description&rdquo;.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nThe CPM will remove the lockfile for a consuming service in the following cases:\n<ul>\n\t<li>A consuming service calls the deregister REST API endpoint</li>\n\t<li>A consuming service does not answer a notification API call (timeout)</li>\n\t<li>The lockfile of a consuming service is older than what is configured as the &ldquo;cleanup-threshold&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\nIf the configuration file is changed, the CPM needs to notice this and notify all registered consuming microservices that there is a change in the configuration (calling the REST API provided by the CCNM inside the consuming microservices).<br />\n<br />\nIf the service starts for the first time, it will inform every consuming microservice to ensure the application of possible changes between last stop and start of CPM.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nThe CPM will read in the configuration file upon start and keep it in memory.<br />\nAll requests of the configuration from consuming microservices will be fulfilled with the configuration in memory for optimal performance.<br />\nIf the file changes, the in memory configuration will be updated.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Configuration Consumer Node Module</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The CCNM is used by consuming microservices to get notified about configuration changes and to retrieve the configuration provided by the CPM.</li>\n\t<li>The CCNM must be a singleton.</li>\n\t<li>The CCNM must have an init function.</li>\n\t<li>The CCNM exposes a config object in every file it is being imported.</li>\n\t<li>The CCNM exposes a function to register at the CPM for notifications about configuration changes.</li>\n\t<li>The CCNM exposes a function to deregister at the CPM.</li>\n\t<li>The address of the CPM is handed over to the CCNM upon initialization.</li>\n\t<li>The CCNM exposes a function that triggers the retrieval of the current configuration from the CPM and replaces the configuration object with the new configuration. If this is not successful, the CCNM must throw an error on which can be caught by the consuming microservice.</li>\n\t<li>The CCNM exposes a listener / event trigger that will be triggered, when a configuration change has happened. The consuming microservice can listen to the change event and implement a custom function, that is executed on a configuration change.</li>\n</ul>\nIn order to retrieve a notification by the CPM about a configuration change, the CCNM must provide a REST API that is listening on port 1337 (port should be configurable). This API must implement the following endpoint:\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>GET /configuration/notify\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Empty payload.</li>\n\t\t<li>No parameters.</li>\n\t\t<li>Returns 200

with our client&rsquo;s internal database</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Project Background</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>This project aims at creating an Action &amp; &nbsp;Fulfillment in Google Assistant</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The Action will allow users to register themselves with a service</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Primarily, the service will notify the user when their printer is low on ink. The user would have shared their printer details with the service earlier (out of scope for this project)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The user can also use our Action to shop for new ink and toner cartridges.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Technology Stack</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Actions on Google (Conversational workflow / DialogFlow)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Nodejs</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Code access</strong></p>\n\n<p>This is the first contest in the series and thus there is no source code to share</p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Individual requirements</strong></p>\n\n<p><u>Create an Action &amp; Fulfillment to register a user with our client&rsquo;s internal database (Major Requirement)</u><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Create Actions Project using the Conversational workflow (DialogFlow).</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>In this, create an action through DialogFlow which will allow a user to register themselves with our client.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The details of this action are as follows:</p>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>The invocation name will be Smart Toner</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>The Default Welcome Intent&rsquo;s response will be &ldquo;Hello, this is Smart Toner here. How can I help you?&rdquo;.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>Additionally, declare a Registration Intent, where the user will intend to register themselves. In its basic form, the user will say &ldquo;I wish to register&rdquo;. However, you need to come up with multiple training phrases that the user can say to trigger this intent. Kindly note that the user could also invoke the action with the registration intent itself (Ok Google, tell Smart Toner &nbsp;that I wish to register), in which case, instead of the Default Welcome Intent, you will trigger the workflow for the Registration Intent immediately.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>The registration intent needs the email address of the user. For this, you will proceed with the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/actions/identity/google-sign-in\">Account Linking based on the Google Sign-In workflow</a>. This means that once the user indicates their intent to register, one of two things will happen:</p>\n\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<p>If this is the first time that the user is using the Action, you will proceed to inform the user that they need an account with Smart Toner. The reason to create an account with Smart Toner will be &ldquo;To fetch the email address used when you registered your printer&rdquo;. If the user gives their consent, proceed to retrieve their email address. You do not have to store the email address, only retrieve it and then proceed with the &ldquo;registration&rdquo; described further below.</p>\n\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<p>If the user has consented to sharing their email address before with our Action, then you should already have their email address information in your conversation object. Use it and proceed with the &ldquo;registration&rdquo; described further below.</p>\n\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>If the user attempts to do anything else beside register, you need to respond to the user with &ldquo;I am sorry, I did not understand that. I can only register you with our Smart Toner service at the moment. Please say `I wish to register` to begin the registration process.&rdquo;</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Registration of a user is through Fulfillment. Use the Inline Editor and write your fulfillment code in nodejs here.</p>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>The code starts off with initializing a variable with a bunch of users in it. Each user will have multiple attributes, namely email address, first name, last name and an attribute named &ldquo;isRegistered&rdquo;. This will be our &ldquo;database&rdquo;. In the next contest, we will integrate an actual database, but for now, we will be mocking it. You need to store 10 or more users in this.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>Next, for the registration intent, once we have the email address with us, we will &ldquo;query&rdquo; the mock database for an entry with the provided email address.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>If an entry is found, we will check the isRegistered column.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>If the isRegistered column has a value of &ldquo;Y&rdquo;, we will respond to the user with &ldquo;Thank you. We find that email address ${email_address} has already been registered&rdquo;. Here email_address refers to the email address of the user which you need to substitute.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>If the isRegistered column has no value, we will change its value to &ldquo;Y&rdquo; and then respond to the user with &ldquo;Thank you. ${email_address} is now registered.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>If no entry is found with the provided email address, we will proceed to respond to the user with &ldquo;Thank you. However, we could not find ${email_address} in our records. We could not complete the registration process.&rdquo;.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>Note that you will NOT add any user to the list of users, only check if the user with that email address exists in your list or not.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p>Irrespective of which scenario plays out and which response is sent to the user, after responding to the user, end the conversation with &ldquo;Thank you for using Smart Toner&rdquo;.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Deployment guide and validation document</strong></p>\n\n<p>You will be sharing the source code that we need to copy into the inline editor for Fulfillment. You will have to describe the steps to import your agent. Finally, the agent itself needs to be connected to Actions on Google, along with a description of how to demo / simulate the assistant with your solution (with account linking).</p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p>Thus, provide a deployment guide that walks us through each of the above steps to deploy your solution. You have to start from the beginning - creating an Actions project, and end with how to test / simulate your solution to verify it. You can provide a markdown based or a Word based document too. Kindly provide images in your deployment guide.</p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Important Notes</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>You are building the Action for Google Assistant, intended for use on Google Home devices.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>You need to support scenarios where the user might not give the correct response or if the user&rsquo;s intent is not understood clearly. Guide the user to register themselves successfully.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\nThe source code that you share, that needs to be copied to the inline editor - lint the code using <a href=\"https://standardjs.com/\">standard</a> lint.<br /><br /><h2>Final Submission Guidelines</h2><p>Zip the source code that needs to be copied over to the inline editor (NOTE that it contains a package.json file too, that you have to share). The exported agent itself will be a zip file. And then there is the Deployment Guide. Archive all three files into a single .zip file and upload to Topcoder.</p>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n","descriptionFormat":"HTML","projectId":11033,"created":"2019-06-07T13:58:47Z","createdBy":"callmekatootie","updated":"2019-06-13T11:52:03Z","updatedBy":"jaya.dhaka","timelineTemplateId":"4df06ca4-367f-4768-93b4-94ba18625983","phases":[{"id":"017b2445-445e-4f53-8c21-6c7570e9eb64","name":"Registration","phaseId":"a93544bc-c165-4af4-b55e-18f3593b457a","duration":259200,"scheduledStartDate":"2019-06-07T14:00:33Z","scheduledEndDate":"2019-06-10T14:05:39Z","actualStartDate":"2019-06-07T14:00:33Z","actualEndDate":"2019-06-10T14:05:39Z","isOpen":false},{"id":"1c26ab1d-6691-417a-8091-945983aeeef5","name":"Submission","phaseId":"6950164f-3c5e-4bdc-abc8-22aaf5a1bd49","duration":258900,"scheduledStartDate":"2019-06-07T14:11:49Z","scheduledEndDate":"2019-06-10T14:10:08Z","actualStartDate":"2019-06-07T14:11:49Z","actualEndDate":"2019-06-10T14:10:08Z","isOpen":false},{"id":"da6eccc9-8220-4ff9-aa05-cfce3191d30e","name":"Review","phaseId":"aa5a3f78-79e0-4bf7-93ff-b11e8f5b398b","duration":172800,"scheduledStartDate":"2019-06-10T14:10:27Z","scheduledEndDate":"2019-06-11T22:37:39Z","actualStartDate":"2019-06-10T14:10:27Z","actualEndDate":"2019-06-11T22:37:39Z","isOpen":false},{"id":"182382d1-abbf-493f-a684-3f57a3e4c3e2","name":"Appeals","phaseId":"1c24cfb3-5b0a-4dbd-b6bd-4b0dff5349c6","duration":86400,"scheduledStartDate":"2019-06-11T22:38:03Z","scheduledEndDate":"2019-06-12T07:57:05Z","actualStartDate":"2019-06-11T22:38:03Z","actualEndDate":"2019-06-12T07:57:05Z","isOpen":false},{"id":"29650e13-1e80-404a-bbd7-189dc36e845c","name":"Appeals

Frequent skills have property </span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-family:courier new; font-size:11pt\">isFrequent === true</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">. See </span><a href=\"https://monosnap.com/file/mkLWas0bRujIojLSne0mQCkQyZEnwN\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-size:11pt\">https://monosnap.com/file/mkLWas0bRujIojLSne0mQCkQyZEnwN</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">. As per the design, frequent skills should be rendered separately as a list of checkboxes. And other skills could be chosen with a select box.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Every skill in JSON has categories property, see </span><a href=\"https://monosnap.com/file/OUofICG38etTtdtb2elYVhePO4B8ZN\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-size:11pt\">https://monosnap.com/file/OUofICG38etTtdtb2elYVhePO4B8ZN</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">. We should only list skills for the selected categories. To determine which categories are selected we should get the value of other question which </span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-family:courier new; font-size:11pt\">fieldName</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\"> we provide inside &ldquo;</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-family:courier new; font-size:11pt\">skillsCategoriesField</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">&rdquo; property of the &ldquo;skills&rdquo; question see </span><a href=\"https://monosnap.com/file/tQc90fbJgLgMGMr72sxDlF7dtv23QP\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-size:11pt\">https://monosnap.com/file/tQc90fbJgLgMGMr72sxDlF7dtv23QP</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">. So in the current template example, we would render only the skills which have at least one category selected in the question </span><strong>&ldquo;What do you need?&rdquo;</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">. We use &ldquo;</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-family:courier new; font-size:11pt\">skillsCategoriesField</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">&rdquo; property to tell the component which other question to use because we don&rsquo;t want to hardcode it, we want to keep the logic as general as possible and not connected to the particular template structure.</span><br />\n\t<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Hint: To get values of other questions we can use </span><a href=\"https://github.com/appirio-tech/connect-app/blob/dev/src/projects/detail/components/SpecQuestions.jsx#L90\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-size:11pt\">currentProjectData</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\"> object which contains all questions answers.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">To handle form we use </span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-family:courier new; font-size:11pt\">formsy-react</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\"> package. Each form &ldquo;field&rdquo; of such form should implement proper methods to work inside a </span><strong>formsy</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\"> form. Please, check another component which renders the list of add-ons as an example </span><a href=\"https://github.com/appirio-tech/connect-app/blob/dev/src/projects/detail/components/AddonOptions/AddonOptions.jsx\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-size:11pt\">https://github.com/appirio-tech/connect-app/blob/dev/src/projects/detail/components/AddonOptions/AddonOptions.jsx</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">. This is component is a very good place to start, as it also renders checkboxes.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">When we choose skills by checkboxes or inside select we should put the values inside </span><strong>one</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\"> array. So the value which would be provided by </span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-family:courier new; font-size:11pt\">SkillsQuestion</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\"> component, would be an array of skills values, which comes from </span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-family:courier new; font-size:11pt\">value</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\"> property, see </span><a href=\"https://monosnap.com/file/6fIS0UgyGXWa04wkkEeTwRXXyxchII\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-size:11pt\">https://monosnap.com/file/6fIS0UgyGXWa04wkkEeTwRXXyxchII</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">. An example value of this form field could be </span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-family:courier new; font-size:11pt\">[1, 2, 5, 213]</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:arial; font-size:12pt\">Read-optimized mode</span></h4>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">When we answer questions and click </span><strong>Next</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\"> button, we render them in `</span><strong>read-optimized</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">` mode inside an </span><strong>Accordion</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">, see </span><a href=\"https://monosnap.com/file/5tHApYK9YEXh5IWXXXRdu2PTohEhJQ\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-size:11pt\">https://monosnap.com/file/5tHApYK9YEXh5IWXXXRdu2PTohEhJQ</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">. We can open accordion and edit the values using normal UI </span><a href=\"https://monosnap.com/file/bkSCib1FWEovlfOGf60NutP7x0ZYPp\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-size:11pt\">https://monosnap.com/file/bkSCib1FWEovlfOGf60NutP7x0ZYPp</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">This should also work for this new question type.

In this challenge, we need your creativity to come up with a design concept for our multinational financial service provider client to unify their initial data collection by independent financial advisors about their future customers with the help of a mobile application.</p>\n\n<p>Read the challenge specification carefully and watch the forums for any questions or feedback concerning this challenge. Let us know if you have any questions in the challenge forum!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Challenge Objectives</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Mobile app design.</li>\n\t<li>Understand the problem and come up with a great solution.</li>\n\t<li>Mobile screens of 750px width.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class='roundLabel'>Round 1</h3><strong>Checkpoint Review</strong><br />\n- We are looking for concepts to make the onboarding experience seamless.<br />\n- Please provide as many screens as you can for checkpoint review so we can provide you feedback on your concept and direction.&nbsp;<br />\n- Provide a MarvelApp link.\n<h3 class='roundLabel'>Round 2</h3><strong>Final Review</strong><br />\n- Your completed design concept with the checkpoint feedback incorporated.<br />\n- Provide a MarvelApp link.<br /><p><strong>Project Background</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Our client is a financial service provider which is planning a strategic move towards increasing collaboration with independent financial advisors (IFAs). The idea is to let the clients of the IFAs to use the infrastructure of our client, and your task is to design a tool &Acirc;&nbsp;for the onboarding process of those end users.</li>\n\t<li>Currently IFAs have several not unified ways to collect initial information concerning their future clients&rsquo; financial position. There is no app used, the IFA needs to sit with the client and go through the forms.</li>\n\t<li>By introducing the onboarding mobile tool, our client would like to simplify the process and offer the IFAs a possibility to customize the questions being asked from the end user. In this way both our client and the IFAs be able to cover all the information they need from the end users, and the data can be sent both to our clients&rsquo; systems and to the IFAs CRM systems as well through our clients&rsquo; API integration.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>User Roles</strong></p>\n\n<p>The system has the 2 following user types:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>IFA </strong>(out of scope):<strong> </strong>The Independent Financial Advisor would be provided with an administrator surface where he can set up his questionnaire for his future clients. The tool would provide him generic questions which he can modify according to his needs. He can then provide a link to his future clients to fill in the onboarding form. Upon receiving the data from his client the IFA can export the data to his own CRM for further use. The IFA can also customize the app visually by adding his own logo to it.</li>\n\t<li><strong>End User </strong>(in scope):<strong> </strong>The end user is the future client of the IFA who would like to invest his money with the help of the IFA using our clients&rsquo; infrastructure. When he is ready to engage, the IFA will send him a link to the onboarding form/tool. Through the proposed tool the end user will fill in all the necessary data. The form will be available to him offline as well, so even in places of weaker connection his task will not be compromised. Whenever he is ready with the form, he can submit it to the IFA.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Screen Requirements</strong></p>\n\n<p>For this challenge we are not providing exact screen requirements. You are free to design as many as you like as long as your screens are in line with the flow..</p>\n<strong>1. Login/Validation</strong>\n\n<p>The end user got a link from the IFA where he can access the onboarding form. What would be the best way to validate those users? Do they get a validation code that they have to input so they get access to their questionnaire? Or do they need a proper login flow?</p>\n<strong>2. Welcome/Introduction</strong>\n\n<p>We need a landing screen where the end user is being informed what is he supposed to do and why he is doing it. Additional information, like how long it will take to fill the form in is also welcomed. If the end user already started to fill in his form, how he can get back to it and continue filling in the form?</p>\n<strong>3. Questionnaire</strong>\n\n<p>We supply different forms that are being used by the IFAs currently to give you an idea about the type of questions. You have to come up with a solution that would be able to handle all types of questions. Please provide samples for the question types and the interaction going on while answering those questions. Please come up with the most user friendly solution for the relatively large number of questions. How you would split up the questionnaire? How would you indicate the answers? Would it be a static text based solution or a chatbot type conversation? Etc.</p>\n<strong>4. Submission</strong>\n\n<p>Upon finishing with all the answers we need a surface where the end user can submit the form to the IRA. You might want to add some information to the end users about the next steps he has to make and and what he can expect after submitting the form.</p>\n<strong>5. Others</strong>\n\n<p>We are opened to suggestions regarding further nice to have functions. For instance, you might want to include a screen where the end user can find the IFA&acirc;&euro;&trade;s profile along with his contacts. What else would be useful for the use case?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Sample forms <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rhoOJW9Tb_pZd-LcVz3OXPBclz8tCK-f\">Link</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Branding Guidelines</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Please consider the below guidelines during your design process:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>We don&#39;t provide branding this time as the IFA will customize the app according to his needs in terms of logo and color scheme.

Implementation will be based on html5</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><u><strong>USER FLOW</strong></u></span>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The Smart Investment Advisor platform is hosted in the cloud and delivered as a web app that enables individual users/investors to:</li>\n\t<li>Explore how the portfolio would have performed under various market scenarios (&quot;what-if&quot; stress tests based on historical bear, base and bull market scenarios)</li>\n\t<li>Understand the factor exposure of their portfolio, relative to benchmarks</li>\n\t<li>Perform screening to identify stock ideas that are favorable under various criteria (e.g. good fundamentals, good momentum)</li>\n\t<li>Understand current market risk sentiment based on established risk indicators</li>\n\t<li>Add, remove or change the weight of securities and see how this would affect overall portfolio return/risk profile; securities are imported from the user&rsquo;s actual brokerage account</li>\n\t<li>Optimize the portfolio according to the &quot;Modern Portfolio Theory&quot;, showing what combinations and weights of securities may achieve the best return/risk for the portfolio</li>\n\t<li>Automatically generate a trading list to execute all necessary trades to achieve the target portfolio composition, taking into account constraints such as available cash, trading costs, round-lot requirements, etc.</li>\n\t<li>Customize key parameters through a settings page - this includes, for example, min/max number of securities in the portfolio, min/max weight of each security, min percent change in securities weight to perform rebalancing trade (to avoid excessive trading), assumed transaction cost, default price limit (as percent above/below market price), etc.</li>\n\t<li>This platform will be fully integrated with an existing web-based financial portaL/trading platform. The app will obtain portfolio information from, and send trading instructions to, an existing trading system via API</li>\n\t<li>Operationally, every day the portfolio advisor engine takes a data feed from the data vendor (e.g. Reuters, Bloomberg), perform a set of proprietary calculations on such data, and store the data in a database to be hosted in a server.&nbsp; The app obtains data from this database to power the portfolio analysis for the web app.&nbsp; The engine also provides an algorithm admin portal where authorized staff may input custom snippets of code that perform proprietary calculations in C#, C++, Python.&nbsp; This ensures that certain analytics IP will be secure.&nbsp; It is expected that the portfolio analytics will be implemented in C#, C++, Python, using various analytics libraries.&nbsp; We have researched how to perform such portfolio analytics, and developed a detailed methodology for how all the calculations should be done, as exemplified with an Excel spreadsheet and/or C#, C++, Python code.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><u><strong>CHALLENGE GOAL</strong></u></span>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The goal of this challenge is to define and develop the best UI/UX screens for our new Smart Investment Advisor mobile app.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><u><strong>DESIGN CONSIDERATION</strong></u></span>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Convey a <strong>TRUSTWORTHY</strong> image - professional, institution-grade, reliable</li>\n\t<li><strong>DELIGHT</strong> the user - intuitive, simple, clean look-and-feel, offer thoughtful touches</li>\n\t<li><strong>EMPOWER</strong> the user - give the user confidence to &ldquo;do-it-myself&rdquo;, experiment and be in control</li>\n\t<li>Keep the user <strong>ENGAGED</strong> - entice frequent visit, make it habitual to use the app daily</li>\n\t<li>Best Practice for Mobile Web App</li>\n\t<li>Easy to navigate the investment process, encourage iterative experimentation</li>\n\t<li>Intuitive for the user; should never be left asking &quot;what do I do next?&quot;</li>\n\t<li>Easy viewing for pages that may be over overcrowded with information (eg. when hovering over an item will enlarge for easy viewing or similar)</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><u><strong>CHALLENGE FORUM</strong></u></span>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>If you have any doubts or questions regarding challenge requirements, please ask in our challenge forum: <a href=\"https://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=ThreadList&amp;forumID=680571\">https://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=ThreadList&amp;forumID=680571</a></li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong><u>SCREEN REQUIREMENTS</u></strong></span><br />\nFor this challenge, we need you to create 4 main screens:\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong>Build Page</strong>, is one vertical scrolling page that shows capabilities for the user to &#39;Explore&#39;, &#39;Design&#39; and &#39;Optimize&#39; their portfolio analysis process using a different variation of modules available in the application and easily move back and forth since the portfolio analysis process is iterative. <strong>Modules needed in this page is from&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"color:rgb(21, 21, 22); font-family:roboto,helvetica,arial,sans-serif\"><strong>&nbsp;01 - 09</strong></span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:rgb(21, 21, 22); font-family:roboto,helvetica,arial,sans-serif\"><strong>Trade Page</strong>, is one page where after the user happy with the finalized portfolio they were doing in the Build page, they can go to this page to execute his trades in real life. <strong>Modules needed in this page is from&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"color:rgb(21, 21, 22); font-family:roboto,helvetica,arial,sans-serif\"><strong>10 - 11</strong></span></span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:rgb(21, 21, 22); font-family:roboto,helvetica,arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:rgb(21, 21, 22); font-family:roboto,helvetica,arial,sans-serif\"><strong><strong>Report Page</strong>, </strong>this page will use <strong><strong>Module 12</strong></strong> mentioned below and this is for our internal use<strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></span></li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:rgb(21, 21, 22); font-family:roboto,helvetica,arial,sans-serif\"><span style=\"color:rgb(21, 21, 22); font-family:roboto,helvetica,arial,sans-serif\"><strong><strong>Help Page, </strong></strong>this page will use<strong> <strong>Module 13 </strong></strong>mentioned below and this help module could appear on any other pages above as needed</span></span></li>\n</ol>\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><u><strong>MODULE REQUIREMENTS</strong></u></span><br />\nFor this challenge, we are looking for the below modules to be designed/considered in your concepts.

If there is a better way to accomplish the same goal, then feel free to take creative liberties.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>00) General Requirements</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>We will need to create a UI Design Kit for the application (You just need to extract each design you&#39;ve created and put them into one single page as UI KIT)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Easy to customize (Needs to support the color/font of different partner sites - Generic feeling)</li>\n\t<li>The design should be robust, modular and scalable</li>\n\t<li>Each screen is a vertically scrolled page that consists of multiple modules</li>\n\t<li>Different modules must show a consistent look-and-feel</li>\n\t<li>Each module has its own expand/collapse mechanism &ndash; either always shown, manual expand/collapse, or auto expand/collapse</li>\n\t<li>Header bar includes top-level menu, partner logo and user profile icons</li>\n\t<li>Help widget tells the user what to do next if user is stuck</li>\n\t<li>Help icon to show additional information as needed</li>\n\t<li>Keep things consistent. This means all graphics styles should work together</li>\n\t<li>All of the graphics should have a similar feel and general aesthetic appearance</li>\n\t<li>Please create the following chart types as part of your design and UI Kit:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Test Portfolio - line chart</li>\n\t\t<li>Monitor Market Risk - bar or column chart or other UX display</li>\n\t\t<li>Generate Ideas - XY scatter chart</li>\n\t\t<li>Optimize Portfolio - line chart (with scatter chart overlay)</li>\n\t\t<li>Adjust Portfolio - bar chart (but need to support drag-and-drop, so perhaps not a real chart)</li>\n\t\t<li>View Exposure - bar chart</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>01) View Alert</strong><br />\n<em>See alerts and hints on next steps</em>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Short message area shows 1-2 key alerts, which may be comments about the portfolio, or what the user should do next</li>\n\t<li>Message area is displayed only when there is a message available; the area automatically collapses when user scrolls down the screen, and only shows up when at the very top of the screen</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>02) Test Portfolio - required for 1st Round</strong><br />\n<em>Stress-test a portfolio to see historical and forecasted performance</em>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Chart shows back-test performance (percent growth of portfolio value) for selected time frame, and a forecast during a forecasting period (equal to 1/5 of historical time frame)</li>\n\t<li>Chart includes chart title, chart labels (horizontal axis = years; vertical axis = percent) and legend for each line; vertical axis should be shown on the right side</li>\n\t<li>Chart displays up to 3 lines (sets of data) of differentiable colors &ndash; for the initial portfolio, revised portfolio, and benchmark</li>\n\t<li>Forecast period shows possible range of value for two levels of probability (lighter shade = lower probability; darker shade = higher probability)</li>\n\t<li>User can select which period in history to use as basis for forecasting if the base case scenario is selected (default is the entire history); this is done by touching the chart area to specify beginning and ending point of period; selected period should be highlighted</li>\n\t<li>User can customize time frame (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15 years)</li>\n\t<li>Summary shows key performance data (return, volatility, Sharpe ratio) for each of the initial portfolio, revised portfolio and benchmark; color of fonts should match that of chart lines for easy reference</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>03) Monitor Market Risk</strong><br />\n<em>View risk indicators to assess market risk environment</em>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Chart shows risk score for 4-6 risk indicators</li>\n\t<li>Each indicator&#39;s score may range from 0 (low risk) to 5 (high risk)</li>\n\t<li>Summary score shows average score of all indicators</li>\n\t<li>User can click on each metric to see expanded view showing some text to explain how the score is determined</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>04) Generate Ideas - required for 1st Round</strong><br />\n<em>Generate new ideas using a factor screening tool</em>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>There are two views of the chart &ndash; normal view and expanded view</li>\n\t<li>Normal view chart shows results of factor screen as a scatter plot (horizontal axis = fundamental factor, vertical axis = momentum factor), with the center (0,0 coordinate) equal to the 50th percentile for both axis</li>\n\t<li>User can select which fundamental factor to use (choose one from 5-10 choices in a menu)</li>\n\t<li>User can select which momentum factor to use (chose one from 5-10 choices in a menu)</li>\n\t<li>Chosen fundamental and momentum factor should be indicated on its respective axis</li>\n\t<li>Each dot (or equivalent) represents one security; security ticker may be placed next to dot or inside small text box</li>\n\t<li>Different colors indicate type of position (e.g. position within existing portfolio, portfolio composite, selected position)</li>\n\t<li>User can click upper-right hand corner (i.e. the top 10 percentile area, indicated by some highlight icon) of scatter plot to show expanded view chart</li>\n\t<li>Expanded view chart shows both positions within existing portfolio (if any) plus new securities not currently in portfolio (use a new color to indicate these)</li>\n\t<li>Expanded view chart still supports the two menus to choose fundamental factor and momentum factor, plus an extra menu to choose Sector (which is a screening mechanism to reduce the number of results)</li>\n\t<li>Action to show expanded view or return to normal view should be intuitive (using animation to show expansion of upper-right corner to occupy full chart)</li>\n\t<li>There may be many overlapping positions &ndash; need a way to resolve potential overlaps</li>\n\t<li>User can click any securities on scatter plot to see details of that security in summary module</li>\n\t<li>User can select any new securities (i.e. not in current portfolio) to add to portfolio; added position shows up in Portfolio Weight module</li>\n\t<li>Analogy: a factor screening tool is a kind of filter &ndash; the idea is to apply a filter to reduce many securities into a smaller number to display based on the user&rsquo;s preferences; design of this feature may draw inspiration from other apps where filters are used (e.g. hotel booking site, Instagram filters, etc.)</li>\n\t<li>Summary shows the ticker, name and score of the selected security; score consists of two values, one for each of the chosen factor across the fundamental and momentum categories</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>05) Optimize Portfolio - required for 1st Round</strong><br />\n<em>Automatically refine position weights to achieve best return/risk</em>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>User selects one of several options &ndash; &quot;Max Sharpe&quot;, &quot;Max Volatility&quot;, &quot;Limit Volatility&quot;, &quot;Required Return&quot;</li>\n\t<li>Chart shows the &ldquo;efficient frontier&rdquo; curve &ndash; this is the optimal portfolio performance at various portfolio weight combinations (horizontal axis = expected volatility, vertical axis = expected return)</li>\n\t<li>Each point represents the best return / risk tradeoff</li>\n\t<li>Chart shows points representing the current portfolio, revised portfolio (if user changes weights of securities within this page), and optimized portfolio</li>\n\t<li>If user chooses &ldquo;Max Sharpe&rdquo;, the optimized portfolio automatically moves to that point on the curve (where Return/Volatility is highest)</li>\n\t<li>If user chooses &ldquo;Min Volatility&rdquo;, the optimized portfolio automatically moves to the left-most point on the curve (where volatility is the lowest)</li>\n\t<li>If user chooses &ldquo;Limit Volatility&rdquo;, a vertical boundary intersects the horizontal axis; user can slide the boundary to specify the acceptable volatility level (i.e. highest acceptable volatility); the optimized portfolio moves to the intersect of the boundary and the curve</li>\n\t<li>If user chooses &ldquo;Required Return&rdquo;, a horizontal boundary intersects the vertical axis; user can slide the boundary to specify the acceptable return level (i.e. lowest acceptable return); the optimized portfolio moves to the intersect of the boundary and the curve</li>\n\t<li>Summary shows the annual return, annual volatility and Sharpe ratio of the optimized portfolio, compared with the current and revised portfolio</li>\n\t<li>Color of fonts should match that of plotted points for easy reference</li>\n\t<li>Optimize function is computationally intensive; therefore, data does not automatically refresh, but require user to click something to request optimization calculation</li>\n\t<li>After optimization calculation, the existing revised portfolio takes on position weights of the optimized portfolio; other modules are updated automatically</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>06) Adjust Portfolio - required for 1st Round</strong><br />\n<em>Manually adjust position weights or add/remove positions</em>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>There are two views of the portfolio list &ndash; Weight view and Expected Return view</li>\n\t<li>Both views show (the superset of) all positions in the initial and revised portfolios</li>\n\t<li>Each position includes the ticker (e.g. AAPL), market (e.g. US), name (e.g. Apple Inc), and a value (what value is displayed depends on which view we are in)</li>\n\t<li>In the Weight view, for each position, a set of bars show the weights of that position in the initial and revised portfolio, along with the percentage value for both</li>\n\t<li>User can easily change weight of each security by touching the bar for the revised portfolio (without typing numbers)</li>\n\t<li>User can add new securities and remove existing securities from the portfolio</li>\n\t<li>User can re-scale portfolio weights so that total weight adds up to 100%</li>\n\t<li>In the Expected Return view, for each position, only show the percentage value for the position&rsquo;s expected annual return; this number is already populated with a default value, but advanced users can still customize it if they want, or click an icon to return to the default value</li>\n\t<li>Need a mechanism to switch between the two views intuitively</li>\n\t<li>Typical number of securities in each portfolio: around 10~30</li>\n\t<li>Securities may include different types (equities, bonds, ETFs, etc.) in different markets &ndash; need a unified way to indicate type and market for each security</li>\n\t<li>One list of securities is shown for both the initial and revised portfolios &ndash; need a way to easily show initial weight and revised weight; some positions may exist only for the initial portfolio, some positions may exist only for the revised portfolio, and other positions exist for both portfolios</li>\n\t<li>Each position must clearly show ticker, market, name of securities, and position weight (both graphic and numeric)</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>07) View Exposure</strong><br />\n<em>View sector exposure, country exposure and asset class exposure data</em>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Sector Exposure list shows sector exposure of portfolio across 10 sectors for both the initial and revised portfolios</li>\n\t<li>Country Exposure list shows country exposure of portfolio across several countries for both the initial and revised portfolios</li>\n\t<li>Asset Class Exposure list shows asset class exposure (e.g. equities, fixed income, commodities, ETFs, etc.) for both the initial and revised portfolios</li>\n\t<li>View Exposure module should support manual expand/collapse, and should be collapsed by default</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>08) Change Settings</strong><br />\n<em>Edit parameter settings and specify expected return for each position</em>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Each setting box consists of a description of the setting and a value</li>\n\t<li>User can click on the value to change it, or reset to default</li>\n\t<li>Change Settings module should support manual expand/collapse, and should be collapsed by default</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>09) Act</strong><br />\n<em>Click action button to perform one-click optimization or one-click trade</em>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>If revised portfolio has not been optimized, button shows &ldquo;Optimize&rdquo;; clicking this button jumps to Optimize Portfolio page and perform optimization calculation</li>\n\t<li>If revised portfolio has been optimized, button shows &ldquo;Trade&rdquo;; clicking this button jumps to Trade screen</li>\n\t<li>Action button should be accessible even when user has scrolled away from the Act module, but possibly minimized to save space</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>10) Review Trades - required for 1st Round</strong><br />\n<em>Review or adjust trade tickets</em>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Each trade ticket consists of security ticker, exchange, security name, buy/sell action, number of shares, price, gross amount, type of trade, and date</li>\n\t<li>Each trade ticket must be displayed as one box; separate trade tickets occupy separate boxes</li>\n\t<li>User can click on any trade ticket to modify specific fields &ndash; number of shares, price, type of trade and date</li>\n\t<li>User can click an icon to return to Build screen</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>11) Confirm Trades</strong><br />\n<em>Send trades to broker site</em>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Action button to confirm trade execution</li>\n\t<li>This module is static and always in view</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>12) Report Page - required for 1st Round</strong><br />\n<em>We would like to collect user pattern data:</em>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Added and deleted securities</li>\n\t<li>Screens visited (time stamp, time duration)</li>\n\t<li>Clicks registered</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>13) Help Page</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The application needs a help page to explain financial concepts and available features</li>\n\t<li>This could be a small pop-up and/or video demo</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<u><strong>DOCUMENTATION</strong></u>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Project SIA - Illustration of Modules.pdf</strong>, to illustrate which modules goes to which page and showing the core content for the modules</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><u><strong>MARVEL PROTOTYPE</strong></u></span>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>We need you to upload your screens to Marvel App</li>\n\t<li>Please send your marvel app request to fajar.mln@gmail.com (Challenge Copilot)&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>You MUST include your Marvel app URL (in your marvel app prototype, click on share and then copy the link &amp;

HPE3PAR apis are in scope)</span></li>\n\t<li>Create db scripts and update the ApiServlet and DiscoveryServlet related classes for the in-scope HPE3PAR apis.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Project Background</h2>\n\n<p>Service Theater is a single/unified web portal that provides simplified management, monitoring, high-end analytics and reporting for the data center environments. It allows enterprises using clouds to consume NextGen offerings characterized by fit for purpose deliverables and demand-driven pay-as-you-go model, by leveraging its northbound APIs.&nbsp; Service Theater brings efficiencies at multiple levels by allowing enterprises to embrace heterogeneity and its advantages<br />\n<br />\nService Theater allows the super admin to add the NextGen offerings for the datacenter from the various cloud storage vendors for the enterprise consumers.<br />\n<br />\nCurrently this service theater has two cloud storage from two vendors (ie. Pure storage and Nexenta)&nbsp;</p>\n<span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:source sans pro,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px\">&nbsp;</span>\n\n<h2>Technology Stack</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Tomcat 6</li>\n\t<li>Java 8</li>\n\t<li>MySQL 5.7</li>\n\t<li>Cloud Stack UI Framework</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Code access</h2>\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/standlove/sdx-hpe3par\">https://gitlab.com/standlove/sdx-hpe3par</a>&nbsp;- please request access in the forum, and please use dev branch.&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"color:rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family:source sans pro,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:12px\">&nbsp;</span>\n\n<h2>Requirements</h2>\nThe app already supports cloud storage services like purestorage and Nexenta, and now we want to onboard the HPE3PAR cloud storage.&nbsp;<br />\nAnd here is how the app works in general:\n<ul>\n\t<li>The app has a DiscoveryServlet, which starts a periodical job to load all the data from the cloud storage service through their exposed APIs and store into a local MySQL database.</li>\n\t<li>The front end pages will load the data from the local database directly most times, but when the user tries to modify the data (e.g. add or delete a volume), it will first call the cloud storage service API to process the request and then update the local database. This is handled by the ApiServlet.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\nAnd here are some general requirements:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Base files should not be extended, instead, new files will be created</li>\n\t<li>LDAP for user authentication is not in the scope</li>\n\t<li>Use Jersey for REST and hpe3par API documentation also had REST-based APIs only</li>\n\t<li>Follow the structure of Nexenta for hpe3par</li>\n\t<li>Jfree charts will be used for charts</li>\n\t<li>Memory and CPU utilisation should also be considered, and it&#39;s in the document.</li>\n\t<li>Pools, Volume, etc will be called as an entity and for each new entity to integrate we will be creating a new table and for the common entity, we may use the existing schemas or alter schemas to add new columns</li>\n\t<li>Operation schemas will have all operation, API path for HPE3PAR, the schemas already exist for purestorage and nexenta</li>\n\t<li>Hpe3par will have a cluster on which 2 nodes will get register, during add storage, we will have to keep that in mind ,so always 2 nodes will be created instead of 1, Cluster means if 1 node goes down, all data will be synced to node 2 automatically, like we have master-slave concept. Please check the API documentation to check the guidelines provided for this and analyse the same.</li>\n\t<li><strong>DB table prefixed with cb_&nbsp;</strong>should not be used</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\nThe following APIs in these sections of the provided HPE3PAR API document is in scope:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Host management&nbsp;\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Creating a host</li>\n\t\t<li>Add or remove a host WWN from target-driven zoning</li>\n\t\t<li>Modifying a host</li>\n\t\t<li>Removing a host</li>\n\t\t<li>Querying all hosts</li>\n\t\t<li>Querying a single host</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\nHere are the tasks for this challenge:\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Create DB Scripts:&nbsp; for each api, you should check existing code to see if there are common DB tables.&nbsp;Create new tables for the new entity. Use common tables for same fields, otherwise create new tables. And you should NOT use json data type.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Backend Update:&nbsp;\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>You need to update the DiscoveryServlet related classes to pull the volumes and remote copies data from hpe3par apis and store into local db.&nbsp;</li>\n\t\t<li>You need to update&nbsp;ApiServlet related classes to add/update apis for the CRUD operations. There is also a wireframe document uploaded to the challenge forum, the apis will be used to for the wirefame pages.&nbsp;</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\nNote you should also create a mockup for the listed HPE3PAR apis (as well as login) so that your implementation can be properly verified.&nbsp;<br /><br /><h2>Final Submission Guidelines</h2><h2>Deliverable</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>DB Script (containing alter statements for existing db tables, and create statements for new db tables).</li>\n\t<li>Postman file for easy testing of the new / updated apis</li>\n\t<li>Patch file for the back-end updates</li>\n\t<li>Update README if necessary and&nbsp;a VerficiationGuide md file containing the verification steps</li>\n\t<li>Simple description about how the APIs will be used in the

This is handled by the ApiServlet.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\nAnd here are some general requirements:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Base files should not be extended, instead, new files will be created</li>\n\t<li>LDAP for user authentication is not in the scope</li>\n\t<li>Use Jersey for REST and hpe3par API documentation also had REST-based APIs only</li>\n\t<li>Follow the structure of Nexenta for hpe3par</li>\n\t<li>Jfree charts will be used for charts</li>\n\t<li>Memory and CPU utilisation should also be considered, and it&#39;s in the document.</li>\n\t<li>Pools, Volume, etc will be called as an entity and for each new entity to integrate we will be creating a new table and for the common entity, we may use the existing schemas or alter schemas to add new columns</li>\n\t<li>Operation schemas will have all operation, API path for HPE3PAR, the schemas already exist for purestorage and nexenta</li>\n\t<li>Hpe3par will have a cluster on which 2 nodes will get register, during add storage, we will have to keep that in mind ,so always 2 nodes will be created instead of 1, Cluster means if 1 node goes down, all data will be synced to node 2 automatically, like we have master-slave concept. Please check the API documentation to check the guidelines provided for this and analyse the same.</li>\n\t<li><strong>DB table prefixed with cb_&nbsp;</strong>should not be used</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\nThe following APIs in these sections of the provided HPE3PAR API document is in scope:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Host sets and virtual volume sets\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Create a host set or VV set</li>\n\t\t<li>Modify a host set or VV set</li>\n\t\t<li>Remove a host set or VV set</li>\n\t\t<li>Query a single host set or VV set</li>\n\t\t<li>Query all host sets or VV sets</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Copy operations\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Creating a volume snapshot</li>\n\t\t<li>Creating group snapshots of a virtual volumes list</li>\n\t\t<li>Resynchronizing a physical copy to its parent volume or stopping a physical copy</li>\n\t\t<li>Promoting a virtual copy</li>\n\t\t<li>Creating a VV-set snapshot</li>\n\t\t<li>Resynchronizing or stopping a VV set physical copy</li>\n\t\t<li>Promoting a VV-set virtual copy</li>\n\t\t<li>Updating virtual copies or VV-sets</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\nHere are the tasks for this challenge:\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Create DB Scripts:&nbsp; for each api, you should check existing code to see if there are common DB tables.&nbsp;Create new tables for the new entity.

The show requires performers to change positions so that their heights match, as close as possible, desired patterns. A full show requires them to move into several different arrangements.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">As the show director wants everything to look as good as possible, it is desired that the heights of the performers at each step are as close as reasonably possible to the prescribed arrangement. However, since the performers are human, it is also necessary to, as much as possible, minimize how much the performers have to move around in between different arrangements. These two factors together determine your score on each test case, and it is up to you to balance the importance of both as you see fit.</span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Test Case Generation</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The number of performers, N, is chosen between 10 and 100.</span><br />\n<span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The number of arrangements, X, is chosen between 2 and 20.</span><br />\n<span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The maximum possible height of a performer, M, is chosen between 10 and 1000.</span><br />\n<span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The height of each performer is chosen between 1 and M.</span><br />\n<span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The desired height at each of the N locations in each of the X arrangements, is also chosen between 1 and M.</span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Parameters</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">heights[] contains the height of each performer, in the order they initially appear on stage. (N can be determined based upon the length of the array)</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">arrangements[] contains the desired performer height for each of the X arrangements. Elements 0...N-1 are the first arrangement, N...2N-1 are the second, and so on.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The return value should indicate the index of the performer to stand at each position, for each of the X arrangements. That is to say, elements 0...N-1 of the return refer to the first arrangement, elements N...2N-1 are the second arrangement, and so on.</span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Scoring</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">For each arrangement, the distance each perform needs to move to get in position, </span><em>dist</em><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">, is calculated. For each position, the difference between the desired height and actual performer height, </span><em>err</em><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">, is calculated.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The score for a test case is then calculated as SUM(</span><em>dist</em><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">) + SQRT(SUM(</span><em>err</em><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">^2))</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Any test case in which your code returns an invalid value, will score a -1. Any test case in which your code exceeds the time limit of 10s, you will score a -2.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Your overall score will be calculated as the sum of BEST/YOURS, for each test case on which you got a positive score, where BEST is the lowest (positive) score anyone received for that test case, and YOURS is your score on that test case. The relative scores are summed, and scaled to 100.0 to give your overall score.</span></p>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n\n<p><strong>Offline Tester</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">An <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qcFAHg6Mlps34104WL5JEjiVjyTzQ6Bz\">offline tester</a> is available for use in this contest.

submission, reviews, review summations and review types.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>It provides a CRUD api for the mentioned resources.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Technology Stack</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Nodejs version 8</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Code access</strong></p>\n\n<p>We have already started with the wrapper by writing it for the Review Types resource. You can find the code <a href=\"https://github.com/topcoder-platform/topcoder-submission-api-wrapper\">here</a>. Use the develop branch as your base and update the source code with the changes for the Reviews resource. DO NOT make changes to the Review Type resource. It should continue to work as it does.</p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Individual requirements</strong></p>\n\n<p><u>Create a wrapper for the Reviews resource of Submission API (Major Requirement)</u></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Submission API source code can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/topcoder-platform/submissions-api\">here</a>. In particular, the swagger specification for the api can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/topcoder-platform/submissions-api/blob/develop/docs/swagger.yaml\">here</a>.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Only the Reviews resource is in scope for this contest.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Create a wrapper for the submission api&rsquo;s reviews resource. The &ldquo;Wrapper&rdquo; will be a nodejs module that will be used instead of directly making HTTP calls to the submission api. The wrapper will expose methods that will be used in place of the direct http calls to the submission api that we are doing currently.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>You can use the <a href=\"https://github.com/topcoder-platform/tc-bus-api-wrapper\">tc-bus-api-wrapper</a> module as a reference. This wrapper is for the <a href=\"https://github.com/topcoder-platform/tc-bus-api\">Topcoder Bus API</a>. Since this is the second contest in the series, you can also check out the wrapper for the review type resource that exists currently in the code base.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>In addition to exposing the methods for each endpoint related to the Reviews resource, you also have to write documentation and tests for the module. The scorecard has dedicated sections for deployment guide and tests and reviewer will use these sections (and not major requirements section) to score issues related to deployment guide and tests</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The documentation and tests will be very similar to the documentation of the bus api wrapper, where the user can view the list of exposed methods, their usage etc.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Deployment guide and validation document</strong></p>\n\n<p>You are creating a nodejs module. As such there is nothing to &ldquo;deploy&rdquo;. Your documentation will be describing how to use the module in any other nodejs based app. The documentation is part of the major requirement.</p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Important Notes</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Use async await pattern</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Use <a href=\"https://standardjs.com/\">standard</a> as your linter. Ensure there are no lint errors in your submission.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Typescript is not allowed. No build or compilation of code expected.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Use mocha and chai for testing. Reviewers kindly note that the review for this section will be taken up under the dedicated Testing section of the scorecard. You will not consider issues with Testing under Major Requirements.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Follow existing conventions used in the app.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<br /><br /><h2>Final Submission Guidelines</h2><p>Zip your solution and upload to Topcoder.</p>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n","descriptionFormat":"HTML","projectId":23581,"created":"2019-06-03T07:32:35Z","createdBy":"callmekatootie","updated":"2019-06-13T11:45:21Z","updatedBy":"jaya.dhaka","timelineTemplateId":"4df06ca4-367f-4768-93b4-94ba18625983","phases":[{"id":"ab77a8ba-5c17-454f-b99e-628ac6352565","name":"Registration","phaseId":"a93544bc-c165-4af4-b55e-18f3593b457a","duration":172800,"scheduledStartDate":"2019-06-03T09:35:12Z","scheduledEndDate":"2019-06-05T09:44:15Z","actualStartDate":"2019-06-03T09:35:12Z","actualEndDate":"2019-06-05T09:44:15Z","isOpen":false},{"id":"fd545625-22f2-4731-83bb-88cae53264af","name":"Submission","phaseId":"6950164f-3c5e-4bdc-abc8-22aaf5a1bd49","duration":172500,"scheduledStartDate":"2019-06-03T09:41:10Z","scheduledEndDate":"2019-06-05T09:44:32Z","actualStartDate":"2019-06-03T09:41:10Z","actualEndDate":"2019-06-05T09:44:32Z","isOpen":false},{"id":"aeb562b8-1d08-4155-925a-de77c3df38f1","name":"Review","phaseId":"aa5a3f78-79e0-4bf7-93ff-b11e8f5b398b","duration":259200,"scheduledStartDate":"2019-06-05T09:44:49Z","scheduledEndDate":"2019-06-07T18:01:38Z","actualStartDate":"2019-06-05T09:44:49Z","actualEndDate":"2019-06-07T18:01:38Z","isOpen":false},{"id":"8975d18c-b565-4348-aec4-43961e4a40e8","name":"Appeals","phaseId":"1c24cfb3-5b0a-4dbd-b6bd-4b0dff5349c6","duration":86400,"scheduledStartDate":"2019-06-07T18:01:57Z","scheduledEndDate":"2019-06-09T03:24:27Z","actualStartDate":"2019-06-07T18:01:57Z","actualEndDate":"2019-06-09T03:24:27Z","isOpen":false},{"id":"29239445-1657-4419-bb6f-9c775763d8cc","name":"Appeals Response","phaseId":"797a6af7-cd3f-4436-9fca-9679f773bee9","duration":43200,"scheduledStartDate":"2019-06-09T03:25:20Z","scheduledEndDate":"2019-06-09T14:58:31Z","actualStartDate":"2019-06-09T03:25:20Z","actualEndDate":"2019-06-09T14:58:31Z","isOpen":false}],"terms":[{"id":"9ef9dec4-dddb-48c9-9cce-659db68bc5ac","roleId":"732339e7-8e30-49d7-9198-cccf9451e221"},{"id":"e3370508-a541-4b9c-b83f-3bad33dcca4c","roleId":"3eedd4a4-3c68-4f68-8de4-a1ca5c2055e5"},{"id":"e3370508-a541-4b9c-b83f-3bad33dcca4c","roleId":"318b9c07-079a-42d9-a81f-b96be1dc1099"},{"id":"e3370508-a541-4b9c-b83f-3bad33dcca4c","roleId":"ff556573-5da6-4392-b38c-08c1d7599c4a"},{"id":"e3370508-a541-4b9c-b83f-3bad33dcca4c","roleId":"e0544b94-6420-4afc-8f63-238eddc751b9"},{"id":"aaa50b65-fb27-44e1-8398-03d70ce4ac5a","roleId":"0e9c6879-39e4-4eb6-b8df-92407890faf1"},{"id":"11ad4ba8-c3ec-4cf9-98e6-c7f43a5bd89f","roleId":"cfe12b3f-2a24-4639-9d8b-ec86726f76bd"},{"id":"e3370508-a541-4b9c-b83f-3bad33dcca4c","roleId":"d663fc84-5c37-43d1-a537-793feffb7667"}],"startDate":"2019-06-03T09:35:12Z","numOfSubmissions":8,"numOfRegistrants":26,"endDate":"2019-06-09T14:58:31Z","currentPhaseNames":[],"registrationStartDate":"2019-06-03T09:35:12Z","registrationEndDate":"2019-06-05T09:44:15Z","submissionStartDate":"2019-06-03T09:41:10Z","submissionEndDate":"2019-06-05T09:44:32Z","prizeSets":[{"type":"placement","description":"Challenge Prizes","prizes":[{"value":700,"type":"USD"},{"value":350,"type":"USD"}]}],"tags":["Node.js","NodeJS"],"groups":[],"winners":[{"handle":"zsudraco","placement":"1"},{"handle":"xuping.huang","placement":"2"}],"metadata":[{"name":"allowStockArt","value":"false"}],"events":[{"id":3451,"name":"2019 Topcoder(R) Open","key":"tco19"}]},{"id":"9cf69a23-087e-4638-83f2-a23758f70f1a","legacyId":"30092334","status":"Completed","track":"Design","type":"Challenge","trackId":"5fa04185-041f-49a6-bfd1-fe82533cd6c8","typeId":"927abff4-7af9-4145-8ba1-577c16e64e2e","legacy":{"track":"DESIGN","subTrack":"WIDGET_OR_MOBILE_SCREEN_DESIGN","forumId":680034,"directProjectId":22883,"reviewType":"INTERNAL","screeningScorecardId":30001363,"reviewScorecardId":30001031,"migration":2},"task":{"isTask":false,"isAssigned":false,"memberId":null},"name":"RUX CollegeSearch Mobile Design Flow Challenge","description":"Welcome to the &quot;<strong>RUX CollegeSearch Mobile Design Flow Challenge</strong>&quot;!

Data import endpoints for both APIs require a matrix of minerals and some additional data (xrd api requires kerogenWeightPercentage , startingDensities, lowerBounds, upperBounds , while CEC api requires wClay, porosity, density, smectiteInMxlIS). We want to update the data import endpoint to support uploading both XRD and CEC values - minerals data will be uploaded anyway (required), and then XRD and/or CEC additional data is provided in the body (both or just one of them). Based on the provided input data, validation should be updated to return correct error messages in case of missing values for either variant of the input data. Another difference in the input data handling between these two apis is that XRD loads minerals data from a CSV file, but CEC loads it from the json payload in request body - we should standardize here on using the CSV file as input for minerals data.</span><br />\n\t<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Calculations for CEC should be updated to use only minerals that have is_clay=true (remaining minerals will be ignored for CEC calculations).</span><br />\n\t<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">XRD calculations that calculate individual steps will remain as is and will only return XRD calculations (only update them to return an error if the data is for CEC and not XRD)</span><br />\n\t<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Get data endpoint (GET /data/:id) should return both XRD and CEC input data</span><br />\n\t<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Create a list data endpoint (GET /data) that will filter the records from database (this endpoint should be migrated from the xrd cec codebase)</span></p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>General requirements</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Unit tests are required for all endpoints.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">All endpoints should be annotated with Swagger annotations and swagger UI should be served by the API.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">All configuration parameters should be extracted to a common settings module.

Their job consists of analyzing the policy and the claim and then manually researching current historical precedent and current trends/news around industry and litigation of these claims. </span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Today, their best source of research is google.com or a paid for research forum &ndash; and the adjustor has to take the initiative to perform the research vs. being pushed content. &nbsp;This is a blend of structured and unstructured data (i.e. take structured claims data and then crawl over public and trusted sources to bring together research / opinion of unstructured data) to help guide the claims adjustor&rsquo;s strategy of settle the claim, litigation or mediation, reinsurance, and or closing the loop of communication with underwriting about how to go to market with future policy language.</span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Technology Stack</strong></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Watson Discovery Service</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Watson Natural Language Understanding Service</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">NodeJS</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Angular / Angular Material</span></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Code access</strong></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">See challenge forms for access to the project codebase.

Once uploaded, the app should use IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding api to extract entities from the text (goal here is to find out the company name from the incident report). Use company name to perform a search with NL query. Also, show the list of all entities extracted from the report (list should be a collapsible container, collapsed by default - it&rsquo;s only an informational list for now)</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Saved search templates</span><br />\n\t<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Allow the user to save current selections as search template (selected collections, entities, keywords, labels) + saved search name.

First add some data to these tabs from PROD site (www.topcoder.com), then come and add new values via your local setup, fill only required fields, the backend would fail but front-end adds the new values to the data table.

These are super fast design challenges where we ask you to quickly understand the provided design problem and you create a design concept in 1-hour!<br />\n<br />\n<strong>RUX 2: 15:30 - 16:30 (submission must be received by 16:45)���</strong><br />\nThe goal of our second 1- Hour RUX Challenge is to create design concepts for a new mobile vehicle assessment application. This vehicle assessment application is focused on a customer who has insured their car with ACME Insurance Corp.<br />\n<br />\nWe are providing a wireframe to help you understand the problem. We now need you to think about this application and in 1-hour create a design concept. It is up to you on what you focus on and the level of fidelity you apply. This challenge is a UI/UX Design Concepts Challenge.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Background</strong><br />\nThe purpose of the application is to help the customer for assessing their vehicle damage if their car has been in an accident. Usually, vehicle damage assessment will be done by on-field insurance agents visiting directly to a customer&rsquo;s place. But this process will take more time to evaluate. So ACME Insurance Corp is planning to use modernize this process by using image analytics to assess the car through photos provided by the customer as that would save a lot of time. Let&#39;s consider a persona &quot;Peter&quot; who insured his car with ACME Insurance Corp and he installed the vehicle assessment mobile application provided by them. The first time he enters his insurance number and the app links to his insurance account and automatically fetches the details of the car &ldquo;make, model, variant, color, etc&rdquo; from the database. Peter then upload his own car pictures in all sides and completed his setup.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>The scenario</strong><br />\nPeter is in a situation where his car was in a small accident in which his car bumper was damaged. His insurance agent wants to assess the vehicle damage so he can calculate the claim amount.&nbsp;<br />\n- Peter launches the vehicle insurance app in his mobile<br />\n- Goes to the assessment screen to raise a claim.<br />\n- He takes pictures of his damaged car in front, left side, right side and uploads them.<br />\n- This mobile app is featured with an AI Image Analytics where the application starts comparing his old car picture and present picture using image analytics and provided assessment result<br />\n- In the assessment result, Peter finds the damage percentage and approximate claim amount that can be claimed.<br />\n- He then shares the report with his insurance agent to proceed with the claim.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Features/Goals:</strong><br />\n- Please see provided&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WiO_BvHd79nOJtZHHRBarUHqJQfblgXR\" target=\"_blank\">wireframes</a><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\">- You are required to design just the one screen provided in the wireframe</span><br />\n- Do not &quot;color&quot; the wireframe - look to create something engaging!<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Users</strong><br />\nThis app will be used by customers who insure their vehicles with ACME Insurance Corp and wants to assess their car.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>General Requirements</strong><br />\n- This is a native iOS application<br />\n- Screen Size: 750px x 1334px<br />\n- Colors are open<br />\n- Fonts are open<br />\n- Upload your JPG/PNG to the challenge between 16:30-16:45.

More than 60 methods have been developed and the list still keeps growing. It&#39;s time to bring fresh ideas to this emerging and exciting field and keep improving.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Preregistration Start Date:</strong> 7th June, 2019<br />\n<strong>Challenge Launch / Live Date:</strong> 21st Dec, 2019<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Challenge Prizes:</strong>&nbsp;$8,000 / $6,000 / $4,000 / $2,000 / $1,000 / $750 / $750 / $500 / $500 / $500\n<h2>Introduction and biological background</h2>\nOur body is comprised of trillions of cells with different functions and programs, and their characterization is an exciting and open scientific question.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nRecent technological progress has allowed us to measure the current state of a cell. In this competition we focus on the transcriptome of a cell (i.e. the expression of the genes), which can be analyzed with single-cell RNA-sequencing technologies. In recent years these techniques have scaled up to being able to assess the expression (i.e. activity) of thousands of genes within tens of thousands of cells.<br />\n<br />\nThe state of a cell often changes gradually, and so does its transcriptome. In fact, cells are constantly changing based on external and internal stimuli. These can include:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Cell differentiation, a process where cells go from a more stem-cell like state to a specialized state.</li>\n\t<li>Cell division, a process where cells replicate their DNA and split into two new cells.</li>\n\t<li>Cell activation, a process where cells are activated by their environment and react to it.</li>\n</ul>\nIf you profile different cells that are all at different stages, you can reconstruct the paths that cells take. These paths are called trajectories, and the methods that infers them from single-cell data are called trajectory inference (TI) methods. An example of such a trajectory is given below, visualized on a 2D dimensionality reduction of a single-cell expression dataset.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(36, 41, 46); font-family:arial; font-size:12pt\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ACRz4wBklveGsGVtCXml06Y5YTSBN3c2LW7TRHk1losQU6OPtWwI4CFyQin3OvA2n-cEHgncW9YvOOx0BhE_QWUUuHnPr1yCOzECaVT3ox9kRaJWWJpQ5H85w3IOxOAAsjf1l_JY\" style=\"height:312px; margin-left:0px; margin-top:0px; width:624px\" /></span><br />\n<br />\nThe topology of a trajectory can range from very simple (linear or circular) to very complex (trees or disconnected graphs).<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(36, 41, 46); font-family:arial; font-size:12pt\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4jw3ogJikIuRwUz7M6pqshLMFKtONe9YEXjwazdqB2T-79dNz1QSE7qHaGkMTUvXXp0U_jfRr_B18_JcnbzPKWOKSSwS_e24hzl9AXj-D_T72jFlS_TzOcISO0hdhbU-ok4pFxC6\" style=\"height:445px; margin-left:0px; margin-top:0px; width:624px\" /></span>\n\n<h2>Problem description and task overview</h2>\nYou are given the expression of thousands of genes within thousands of cells. This expression is given as a counts matrix, indicating how often a particular gene was counted within a cell. The goal is to construct a topology that represents these cells, and to place these cells on the correct locations along this topology. The basic idea is that cells that have similar expression should be closer in space. You can think of a cell as a vector in a N-dimensional space, the component of this vector are the genes and the values the gene expression. In this way it is possible to define formally a distance/similarity between cells. The big picture is: how can we order and organize the cells into a topology that captures their potential paths across a biological process?<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(36, 41, 46); font-family:arial; font-size:12pt\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/PstqIUGMKp4qE6Z4kgVxyuK6P9pL6NHBo_e6sLmqs2Xy3IbPnImGmPNBt120WUNm3gQ2aAof_q3kgVHZF40HDPppHN3619oPXllZG9VCgHUn-x6MN4SHnMQy7N2Eggnz54Wq0moY\" style=\"height:217px; margin-left:0px; margin-top:0px; width:624px\" /></span><br />\n<br />\nThe topology is a graph structure, in this context called the milestone network as it connects &ldquo;milestones&rdquo; that cells pass through. Each edge within the milestone network can only be present once, and every edge has an associated length, which indicates how much the gene expression has changed between two milestones.<br />\n<br />\nThe cells are placed at a particular position of this milestone network. We represent this as &ldquo;progressions&rdquo;, where each cell is assigned to an edge and a percentage indicating how far it has progressed in that edge.\n<h2>Quick start</h2>\nTo get started, we have provided&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J-hY84Cwhpc6oDCMFPsS9oMUsazJskFJ\">example submissions</a>&nbsp;in a few different programming languages. These examples infer a simple linear trajectory by using the first component of a principal component analysis as progression. See the forum for <a href=\"https://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Announcement&amp;annID=3088\">detailed information about these examples</a>.\n\n<h2>Detailed description and submission format</h2>\nThis match uses the &quot;submit code&quot; submission style. The required format of the submission package is specified&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/topcoderinc/marathon-docker-template/tree/master/code-only-style\">in a submission template document</a>. This current document gives only requirements that are either additional or override the requirements listed in the template.<br />\n<br />\nYou must not submit more often than 2 times a day. The submission platform does not enforce this limitation, it is your responsibility to be compliant to this limitation. Not observing this rule may lead to disqualification.<br />\n<br />\nAn exception from the above rule: if your submissions scores 0 / -1 / X / Fails, then you may make a new submission after a delay of 7 hours from your last submission timestamp. But you are only allowed to do this once a day. We have seen in the past that due to TC systems still scoring in background, competitors tends to think that submission has failed, and they keep submitting multiple times choking our submission queue and also adding duplicate submissions in queue. This is to avoid such scenarios and since each submission can take a long time to be processed on our systems, we need to ensure that TC systems are not unnecessary burdened.<br />\n<br />\nTo allow you to use whatever language and tools you are familiar with, we are asking to provide a Docker container that will read in the input files and write out the output files in mounted folders. So you can use whatever you want inside this Docker, we only ask you to make sure to respect the input and output format.<br />\n<br />\nMore precisely, this container has to have an entrypoint that will read in two command-line arguments: the location of the input file and the location of the output folder. To make your life easier, we provide examples of Dockerfiles (and associated entrypoints) for all of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J-hY84Cwhpc6oDCMFPsS9oMUsazJskFJ\">example submissions</a>. Make sure to specify the entrypoint using the JSON notation, with square brackets, as is shown in the examples.<br />\n<br />\nThe input file is an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/whatishdf5.html\">HDF5 file</a>, which contains a matrix: the counts (<span style=\"font-family:courier new,courier,monospace\">/data/counts</span>). This matrix contains the expression of genes (columns) within hundreds to millions of cells (rows). Example HDF5 files are present in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xhn59uxIQ6JCnLkVkNyGK16VOdsrjQjT\">examples inputs folder</a>&nbsp;(<span style=\"font-family:courier new,courier,monospace\">dataset.h5</span>).<br />\n<br />\nBecause the data is very sparse, the matrix is stored inside a sparse and memory efficient format:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csc_matrix.html\">Compressed Sparse Column format (CSC)</a>. For an example of how to read in these matrices, refer to the example submissions. This format stores three sparse array,&nbsp;<em>i</em>,&nbsp;<em>p</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>x</em>. This is a column-oriented format, in which&nbsp;<em>x</em>&nbsp;contains the actual values,&nbsp;<em>i</em>&nbsp;contains the row index for each value, and&nbsp;<em>p</em>&nbsp;points to column starts in&nbsp;<em>i</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>x</em>&nbsp;(i.e.&nbsp;<em>p<sub>j</sub></em>&nbsp;until&nbsp;<em>p<sub>j+1</sub></em>&nbsp;are the values from&nbsp;<em>x</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>i</em>&nbsp;that are in column&nbsp;<em>j</em>). For example:<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new,courier,monospace\">p = [0, 1, 3, 6]<br />\ni = [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2]<br />\nx = [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66]</span><br />\n<br />\nProduces the matrix:<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new,courier,monospace\">11 22 44<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp;33&nbsp;55<br />\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 66</span><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nWe also provide&nbsp;<em>rownames</em>&nbsp;with unique cell identifiers, and&nbsp;<em>dims</em>&nbsp;with the dimensions of the matrix, i.e. how many cells and how many genes we need to analyze.<br />\n<br />\nYour solution should output two comma separated files:\n<ol>\n\t<li>The&nbsp;<em>milestone_network.csv</em>&nbsp;is a table containing how milestones are connected (<em>from</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>to</em>) and the lengths of these connections (<em>length</em>).&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>The&nbsp;<em>progressions.csv</em>&nbsp;contains for each cell (<em>cell_id</em>) where it is located along this topology (<em>from</em>,&nbsp;<em>to</em>, and a&nbsp;<em>percentage</em>&nbsp;in [0, 1]).&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\nBoth outputs have to be saved as a comma separated file without an index but with header. Example CSV files are present in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16sZMjSy_ZpSWmjPUp_E-0Msq2GeEVvD2\">examples outputs folder</a>&nbsp;(<em>progressions.csv</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>milestone_network.csv</em>):<br />\n<br />\nExample&nbsp;<em>milestone_network.csv</em>:<br />\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new,courier,monospace\">from,to,length<br />\nA,B,1</span><br />\n<br />\nExample&nbsp;<em>progressions.csv</em>&nbsp;(first 10 rows):<br />\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new,courier,monospace\">cell_id,percentage,from,to<br />\nC1,0.2304303,A,B<br />\nC2,0.1537403,A,B<br />\nC3,0.9627531,A,B<br />\nC4,0.0811708,A,B<br />\nC5,0.2478125,A,B<br />\nC6,0.3013250,A,B<br />\nC7,0.2876437,A,B<br />\nC8,0.1923322,A,B<br />\nC9,0.1827381,A,B<br />\nC10,0.1598463,A,B</span><br />\n<br />\nThe&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J-hY84Cwhpc6oDCMFPsS9oMUsazJskFJ\">example submissions</a>&nbsp;also demonstrate how to save these two objects.\n\n<h2>Training data</h2>\nIn addition to the example inputs and outputs, there is a large sample of additional cases on which to train or tune your approaches. These are designed to cover the full range of trajectories and data scales from the provisional and final test cases, but they are not necessarily drawn from the same pools of data originally.<br />\n<br />\nThe majority of examples are considered &ldquo;normal&rdquo; size, and are available in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jFykCbDHXFIdc7rYGKFCKubwSJBraGnL\">public training data folder</a>. Two others are considered extra-large, and have been pulled aside into a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V2ad2s2piQQUVahD-QkKumekVs1QLkGh\">big-train folder</a>&nbsp;for clarity. Can your solution scale?\n\n<h2>Code requirements</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Your code must process the test cases independently from each other. When processing a test case you MUST NOT read data from any other folder than those specified in the corresponding parameters files, and those folders that are already part of your submission. Breaking this rule is strictly against the rules and spirit of the contest and leads to immediate disqualification.</li>\n\t<li>The allowed time limit for the submission during provisional testing is 5 hours for 80 cases. The final test set may have a different number of cases or a different distribution of case sizes, but the overall time limit will be scaled according to the change in baseline times.</li>\n\t<li>There is no per-case time limit, but there is a run time scoring component.</li>\n\t<li>Your Docker image will be run on a high-memory Linux AWS r5.xlarge instance.&nbsp; Please refer to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/\">the AWS documentation</a>&nbsp;for the details of this instance type.</li>\n\t<li>The Docker container for your solution will be run with a 24G memory limit.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Evaluation</h2>\nYour output will be compared to the known (or expected) trajectory for a set of synthetic and real datasets with different topologies, cell or gene number, and increasing difficulty. This is done using four metrics, each contributing (on average) 1/4th to the overall score. In addition we provide some &ldquo;baseline&rdquo; methods already developed by the community, so you can have a sense of how far you are from the &ldquo;best&rdquo; methods.&nbsp;More detail about these baseline methods is available in <a href=\"https://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Announcement&amp;annID=3086\">the forums</a>.&nbsp;Can you beat them?\n\n<h3>Similarity between the topologies</h3>\nThis l calculates a distance measures between two topologies. The score ignores any &ldquo;in between&rdquo; milestones, i.e. those with degree 2. It therefore does not matter whether you return a trajectory as a network A-&gt;B-&gt;C versus A-&gt;B. The order of the edges also doesn&rsquo;t matter.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(36, 41, 46); font-family:arial; font-size:12pt\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Tan0Px5JhAkuNxiGbVM3ezLDFcEO2pA3AuloZzc6qj4P3HhD9ISKL1G5AauCpGV-eN1K_1c0lPOqewEgI7hIKnZLSbbIvjeJX-N1UpRUjmPEG2HeeB4Otv-8hS-RTraUHT_YVk0N\" style=\"height:249px; margin-left:0px; margin-top:0px; width:624px\" /></span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new,courier,monospace\">network1 &lt;- datasets$bifurcating %&gt;%<br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;simplify_trajectory() %&gt;%<br />\n&nbsp; .$milestone_network<br />\nnetwork2 &lt;- datasets$bifurcating2 %&gt;%<br />\n&nbsp; simplify_trajectory() %&gt;%<br />\n&nbsp; .$milestone_network<br />\n<br />\ndyneval::calculate_him(network1, network2)<br />\n##&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;HIM&nbsp;<br />\n## 0.9233855</span>\n\n<h3>Similarity between the assignment of cells to particular branches</h3>\nA branch is defined as a set of edges with no branching points, i.e. just a linear progression from one milestone to another milestone. This metric checks whether each branch with the gold standard can be mapped to a similar branch in the predicted trajectory, and vice versa. It does this by first calculating the number of overlapping cells between each pair of branches using a Jaccard score:<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(36, 41, 46); font-family:arial; font-size:12pt\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/93cmD0X69MExGXZIRPeBNW78xMC-YnlP0-O9vpSzgXbeHlmmRMG5SRxckZQ-iE8u6ksqmxdu36ykcYNL_wwOtClASq_bErdznvlgBIbFr_khwOzJaSLtqdMV1J4PGtEnMwGdzZ_e\" style=\"height:44px; margin-left:0px; margin-top:0px; width:179px\" /></span><br />\n<br />\nIt then calculates two scores.

A harmonic mean is used here to make sure that both the&nbsp;<em>Relevance</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Recovery</em>&nbsp;are high. If either score is low, the harmonic mean will also be low. In the worst case, if either component is zero, the harmonic mean is also zero.\n\n<h3>Similarity between relative positions of cells within the trajectory</h3>\nTo determine whether cells have similar positions in the trajectory, we first calculate the geodesic distances between every pair of cells. The geodesic distance is defined as the shortest distance between two cells by following the edges within the trajectories. The lengths of the edges are taken into account in this calculation, but not the direction. This distance is illustrated in the following figure:<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(36, 41, 46); font-family:arial; font-size:12pt\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/VLkTJZxIQ8UItKsBQsJe7Lb6b8JAwE9NutKOiZ4w3VkG93G72UrjLcLApqT-YJGHmGIyTR6wXFlFhxqm1LPXV0DCTUY5oeHywq41z6E5nZNOqHXco9D_5q8HoDW00hwXq3XyQlit\" style=\"height:551px; margin-left:0px; margin-top:0px; width:624px\" /></span><br />\n<br />\nIf a cell has a similar position in both the ground truth trajectory as in a predicted trajectory, it&rsquo;s distance should also be relatively similar to other cells. To calculate the similarity between the relative positions of cells, we therefore calculate the Spearman&rsquo;s correlation between all pairwise geodesic distances. Because we calculate a correlation, the absolute magnitude in the geodesic distances doesn&rsquo;t matter, but rather the distance relative to all other distances.\n<h3>Running time</h3>\nThe per-case running time in seconds is compared to a baseline time. If the case runs as fast as the baseline or faster, the time score is 1. Otherwise, the score decreases to 0 as&nbsp;<span style=\"font-family:courier new,courier,monospace\">baseline / time</span>, e.g. running twice as long as the baseline will score as 0.5. The baseline is computed based on the number of cells in the test case, plus some time for setup, as:<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new,courier,monospace\">baseline = 10 + 0.01 * cells</span><br />\n<br />\nThere is no limit on per-case run time, but there is an overall limit of 5 hours to process all 80 provisional cases. This is enough to take twice as long as the baseline timing, plus some margin for error and system overhead.\n<h3>Score aggregation</h3>\nThe metrics are aggregated for each dataset using a geometric mean. That means that low values (i.e. close to zero) for any of the metrics results in a low score overall. They are also weighted so that:\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>A slight difference in performance for more difficult datasets is more important than an equally slight difference for an easy dataset.</li>\n\t<li>Datasets with a more rare trajectory type (e.g. tree) are given relatively more weight than frequent topologies (e.g. linear).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Evaluating a method locally</h2>\nYou can run a method and the evaluation locally using the script&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zG5mPFFxZ_l0prGGzo62kFr2CLbHRveA\">scripts/example.sh</a>:<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"font-family:courier new,courier,monospace\"># download the datasets and put them inside the datasets/training/ folder<br />\n<br />\n# build the method container<br />\nCONTAINER_FOLDER=containers/tc-submissions/submission-r/code<br />\nIMAGE=dynverse/python_example<br />\n<br />\nchmod +x $CONTAINER_FOLDER/main.py<br />\ndocker build -t $IMAGE $CONTAINER_FOLDER<br />\n<br />\n# create a folder to store the output and scores<br />\nOUTPUT_FOLDER=$(pwd)/results<br />\nOUTPUT_MOUNT=&quot;-v $OUTPUT_FOLDER:/outputs/&quot;<br />\nmkdir $OUTPUT_FOLDER<br />\n<br />\n# define the folders where the data is stored<br />\nDATA_FOLDER=$(pwd)/datasets/training/<br />\nDATA_MOUNT=&quot;-v $DATA_FOLDER:/data/&quot;<br />\n<br />\n# run on one dataset --------------------------------------------<br />\n# this uses the default entrypoint<br />\nDATASET_ID=real-gold-aging-hsc-old_kowalczyk<br />\n<br />\nmkdir $OUTPUT_FOLDER/$DATASET_ID<br />\n/usr/bin/time -o $OUTPUT_FOLDER/$DATASET_ID/time.txt -f &quot;%e&quot; \\<br />\n&nbsp; docker run $DATA_MOUNT $OUTPUT_MOUNT $IMAGE \\<br />\n&nbsp; /data/inputs/${DATASET_ID}.h5 /outputs/${DATASET_ID}/<br />\nls $OUTPUT_FOLDER/$DATASET_ID<br />\n<br />\n# run on many datasets ------------------------------------------<br />\n# this uses the runner script (scripts/runner.sh)<br />\nsh scripts/runner.sh $DATA_FOLDER $OUTPUT_FOLDER $IMAGE<br />\n<br />\n# then evaluate it using the dyneval docker<br />\ndocker run $DATA_MOUNT $OUTPUT_MOUNT dynverse/tc-scorer:0.3<br />\n<br />\n# the overall score is present in ...<br />\ncat $OUTPUT_FOLDER/AGGREGATED_SCORE<br />\n<br />\n# the scores on each dataset can be viewed in<br />\nhead $OUTPUT_FOLDER/dataset_scores.csv</span>\n\n<h2>Additional information</h2>\n\n<h3>Normalization of datasets</h3>\nSingle-cell RNA-seq datasets are often normalized so that the expression of different cells is more comparable. This can involve:\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Dividing the counts of each cell by the total number of counts per cell.</li>\n\t<li>Log2 normalisation.</li>\n\t<li>Many more complex approaches that are available in packages such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/scran.html\">scran</a>&nbsp;(R/Bioconductor),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/ChristophH/sctransform\">sctransform</a>&nbsp;(R) and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">scanpy</a>&nbsp;(Python).</li>\n</ul>\nWhether normalisation is necessary depends on what you do with the data. For example, it will be more important if you calculate some Euclidean distances, but useless if you calculate rank correlations.\n\n<h3>Difficulty of datasets</h3>\nThere is a broad gradient of difficulty among the datasets. Some datasets could be solved by pen and paper, while others may almost be impossible to correctly define the trajectory. Don&rsquo;t try to optimise a method for all datasets, but rather try to learn from datasets that are next in your &ldquo;difficulty&rdquo; frontier.<br />\n<br />\nYou can get an overview of the estimated difficulty of a dataset in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dwGCaO84oduxqX87N5M9wFpg_MMqoYWg\">difficulties.csv</a>.&nbsp; The&nbsp;<em>mean</em>&nbsp;column gives you the difficulty rating for each component of the score (the lower the more difficult), while sd gives the standard deviation, which affects how much a deviation from the average will impact scoring. One factor in the difficulty is the kind of trajectory topology: linear and bifurcating datasets are often easier than graph or tree datasets.\n\n<h3>Further reading</h3>\n<a href=\"http://em.rdcu.be/wf/click?upn=lMZy1lernSJ7apc5DgYM8RY2IzMp2w2A3DvtZzsJuXQ-3D_pHvsHvhfQaoNOkiaWNdPTjEYljnHm5S7EpH3PfJ5poSURd1eHm2H4ZrZffcWuk-2FVAindB7MLQFXJP7SDz5ymc76HIgI5DN8-2FH4-2F0TSTEWycfk1kcZnplv69A2DcepMUlm91KK1RoNKzOirYAwv80Lt5hqKoaTim-2B0sBTAo6vy56EGHpLul12jZ1a9APM7IdmLQr043l6b9bkFfA7ziZOCz0RTd1L7AMKVtxjW5BlMgjfDbYlrbJoP98nzAtGp0amLM5xaU0-2FmLwX0enc7rmd9Q-3D-3D\">A comparison of single-cell trajectory inference methods (2019)</a>: Benchmarking study of current state-of-the-art methods for trajectory inference.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-019-0071-9\">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-019-0071-9</a><br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.170506\">Concepts and limitations for learning developmental trajectories from single cell genomics (2019)</a>: A review on trajectory inference algorithms\n\n<h2>Final testing</h2>\nBecause of the &quot;submit code&quot; style used in this match there are no significant differences between provisional and final testing of your solution quality. During final testing your code will be executed on sequestered data that were not used in the provisional testing phase. The test set may have a different number of cases or a different distribution of case sizes, but the overall time limit will be scaled according to the change in baseline times.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, as an additional step, the training process will also be verified to make sure that your results are reproducible using only the data sources that are allowed as training data. Note that this step will not be done during the submission phase, so you should take extra care in testing that your training process runs error free. In case either we can not reproduce or complete this step, you might not qualify for a prize.\n<h2>General notes</h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>This match is rated.</li>\n\t<li>Relinquish - Topcoder is allowing registered competitors to &quot;relinquish&quot;.

Id field will have to be generated by the app and cannot be passed during resource creation / update.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>You need to support pagination</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><u>Implement the endpoints in Nodejs (Major Requirement)</u></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>After writing the specification, proceed to implement them in Nodejs.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Use <a href=\"https://expressjs.com/\">Express js</a> as your server framework.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Implement all the endpoints to match the specification defined in Swagger.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Use Dynamodb as your database.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The endpoints will have a prefix of &ldquo;/v5/lookups&rdquo;. Countries will come under &ldquo;/v5/lookups/countries&rdquo; and &ldquo;/v5/lookups/educationalInstitutions&rdquo;</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Deployment guide and validation document</strong></p>\n\n<p>Create a deployment guide using markdown. Provide instructions on how to deploy your app locally.</p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Important Notes</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Use <a href=\"https://standardjs.com/\">standard</a> as your linter. Ensure there are no lint errors and create a npm script to allow us to run the linter.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#FF0000\">You need to provide unit tests and end to end tests using mocha and chai for all the endpoints. Reviewers will consider the section in the scorecard dedicated for tests and not consider this in the Major Requirements section. Test coverage needs to be more than 80%.</span></li>\n\t<li>���Each endpoint requires authorization. Follow the same logic <a href=\"https://github.com/topcoder-platform/submissions-api/blob/develop/app.js#L85\">as used by the submission api</a> in securing the endpoints. You do not have to worry about which users are allowed access - <a href=\"https://github.com/topcoder-platform/submissions-api/blob/develop/src/routes/SubmissionRoutes.js#L11\">Topcoder User or Copilot roles or scopes</a> or something similar as long as you make provisions to allow us to update them. Use the <a href=\"https://github.com/appirio-tech/tc-core-library-js\">tc-core-library-js</a> for your authentication purposes. (You will find examples in the submission api on how you can use this module).</li>\n</ul>\n<br /><br /><h2>Final Submission Guidelines</h2>Zip your source code and upload it to Topcoder. Ensure that there are no lint errors, that it has the swagger specification in it and also the Deployment Guide.","descriptionFormat":"HTML","projectId":10905,"created":"2019-05-31T15:36:50Z","createdBy":"callmekatootie","updated":"2019-06-13T11:41:42Z","updatedBy":"jaya.dhaka","timelineTemplateId":"4df06ca4-367f-4768-93b4-94ba18625983","phases":[{"id":"aa452052-d2fd-42c5-b1b7-24e3544caf0c","name":"Registration","phaseId":"a93544bc-c165-4af4-b55e-18f3593b457a","duration":259200,"scheduledStartDate":"2019-05-31T16:06:38Z","scheduledEndDate":"2019-06-03T16:08:36Z","actualStartDate":"2019-05-31T16:06:38Z","actualEndDate":"2019-06-03T16:08:36Z","isOpen":false},{"id":"12ea1d38-69f7-4525-afe0-ec6c88c521bd","name":"Submission","phaseId":"6950164f-3c5e-4bdc-abc8-22aaf5a1bd49","duration":258900,"scheduledStartDate":"2019-05-31T16:32:27Z","scheduledEndDate":"2019-06-03T16:32:49Z","actualStartDate":"2019-05-31T16:32:27Z","actualEndDate":"2019-06-03T16:32:49Z","isOpen":false},{"id":"dba1d74c-e8fb-41f8-87a1-71b8478811a8","name":"Review","phaseId":"aa5a3f78-79e0-4bf7-93ff-b11e8f5b398b","duration":172800,"scheduledStartDate":"2019-06-03T16:33:10Z","scheduledEndDate":"2019-06-05T15:26:36Z","actualStartDate":"2019-06-03T16:33:10Z","actualEndDate":"2019-06-05T15:26:36Z","isOpen":false},{"id":"ad7389fe-c3ff-4287-acb6-f0f7ff198faf","name":"Appeals","phaseId":"1c24cfb3-5b0a-4dbd-b6bd-4b0dff5349c6","duration":86400,"scheduledStartDate":"2019-06-05T15:26:54Z","scheduledEndDate":"2019-06-06T15:28:24Z","actualStartDate":"2019-06-05T15:26:54Z","actualEndDate":"2019-06-06T15:28:24Z","isOpen":false},{"id":"09c63d59-b28b-4d4f-9a95-dbf445e965d7","name":"Appeals
