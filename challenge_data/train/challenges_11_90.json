So we&#39;d like to give users an overview of their CO2 consumption and set that in ratio to make the implications clear. Our app needs to measure this.</li>\n\t<li>The main purpose of this application is to track, score and provide an overview of CO2 consumption, driving behavior, and individuals&#39; sustainable impact (like a &ldquo;CO2-fitness-tracker&rdquo;).</li>\n\t<li>Users will engage - i.e create CO2 saving networks by group Scoring and Ranking.</li>\n\t<li>Users will Compete/Gamify - ie compare the score with other users.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Design Goals &amp; Principles</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Components arrangement and layout must be clean: be thoughtful about the elements that are truly needed for the user in the screen space.</li>\n\t<li>Simplicity: the design should consider frictionless paths to achieve the goals. Avoid placing too many buttons or overcomplicating the workflow steps.</li>\n\t<li>The design solution should be easy to understand.</li>\n\t<li>Open to variants from the branding guidelines. We want to explore colors that help making the application more engaging. This will be a &ldquo;sponsored by&rdquo; framed application, so the provided branding should be visible but not the main center of attention.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Business Goals</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Collect data to get an overview over users CO2 consumption.</li>\n\t<li>Marketing: attract new users to our brand.</li>\n\t<li>Network externality effects: expanding user circle per word of mouth.</li>\n\t<li>Positioning us as a sustainable-oriented company.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Application Fundamentals &amp; Concepts</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Co-driver: we want to motivate users to take other people in their car with them if they are heading the same way. If users drive with their friends or family in a car, we may take less of their consumed CO2 into account to incentivize ridesharing.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>To measure co-drivers:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>Users may enter if they are taking other people with them in the app.</li>\n\t\t\t<li>We may allow co-drivers who have also installed the app, so we can measure it by tracking their GPS. The second possibility sounds better and would be more attractive for users because it&#39;s more convenient; it would also improve network externality effects.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Driving behavior: The CO2 consumption depends on car type, how many miles users drive, and how they drive (what we call driving behavior).\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>We are convinced that lower CO2 consumption positively correlates with driving safe, that means that people who are always driving fast in curves, often exceed the speed limit and brake hardly are consuming more CO2. We want to include this in users&#39; CO2-consumption value.</li>\n\t\t<li>To measure the driving behavior, first, we need to record users&#39; GPS-data because it gives us an overdriven overview route, speed, and driving behavior to some extent. Second, we need the gyroscope data of users&#39; mobile phones to see how users drive in curves and if they are braking or speeding up hardly. We may also record information about objects nearby their mobile devices to be sure about their current position.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Mobility: we want to incentivize users to lower their CO2 consumption by traveling by train or bus more often.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>To measure mobility, either user enters this manually, or we may also capture this from the GPS coordinates get from users&#39; mobile phones (if users are moving on a railroad track and with a train typical speed we can assume that they are currently riding by train).</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Saving network: we want to enable users to build up saving networks and compare their CO2 consumption to their friends and family. The competitive character may incentivize them to lower their consumption by driving more environmentally friendly. Enabling users to interact with others promotes the dissemination of the app by word of mouth.</li>\n\t<li>Score system: it is basically built of:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Car type.</li>\n\t\t<li>Driven km.</li>\n\t\t<li>Driving behavior.</li>\n\t\t<li>Co-drivers.</li>\n\t\t<li>Mobility.</li>\n\t\t<li>Network.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Screens/Features</strong><br />\n<u>Note:</u><br />\nThese are skeleton requirements, brainstormed features simply to be used as inputs into this challenge. Feel free to come up with ideas and concepts for this mobile concept, we are open to alternative workflows and alternative features not listed here that would help the overall application. In terms of expectations, we would like to measure the concept against the following in the one to ten scales:\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Creativity: 8</strong><br />\n\t1: barely new ideas<br />\n\t10: a utopic product with features not proven to be able to be fully implemented</li>\n\t<li><strong>Aesthetics: 7</strong><br />\n\t1: low-fidelity design, wireframe or plain sketch<br />\n\t10: top-notch finished looking visual design</li>\n\t<li><strong>Exploration: 9</strong><br />\n\t1: strictly follow an existing reference or production guideline<br />\n\t10: open to alternative workflows/features not listed here that would help the overall application</li>\n\t<li><strong>Branding: 4</strong><br />\n\t1: don&#39;t care at all about the branding just functionality<br />\n\t10: without a properly branded product there is no success</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#FF8C00\">01. User Authentication</span>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>User signs in with email address and password.</li>\n\t<li>Signing in with an account from another social media network (Facebook, Snapchat, etc)</li>\n\t<li>Selecting car type\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Open to suggestions to handle this feature.</li>\n\t\t<li>Maybe small buses for large families but not more than seven seats, because the app is more thought for private usage.</li>\n\t\t<li>For us, it is interesting which car the user is driving and in what condition the vehicle is. It may include tire pressure, battery voltage, and other indicators that give us information about the general car condition.</li>\n\t\t<li>We may get this information from the car manufacturers because they already measure them, but we&#39;re currently not sure about that.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>It needs to be clear and simple.</li>\n\t<li>Less data as possible given by the user.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#FF8C00\">02. Home</span>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>First screen users normally see when opening the app.</li>\n\t<li>Overview\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Consumed CO2.\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>Absolute value, basically build of car type, driven miles and driving behavior.</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Co-drivers, new mobility and network have no impact on absolute CO2 consumption.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>Consuming score (scale):\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>Includes all the indicators we are measuring (CO2 consumption, Co-drivers, new mobility, networks).</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Our current idea is to take &quot;saved trees&quot; as a unit for the score representation, which means telling users how many trees they&#39;ve saved by improving driving behavior/ taking co-drivers, riding by train, enlarging their networks.</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Saved trees by people in user networks may count proportionally for the user too. This would incentivize the recommendation of the app by word of mouth because users get incentives to enlarge their networks.</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Other ideas are accepted. We are open to exploring this concept.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#FF8C00\">03. Register Activity</span>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>In order to increase the score, any of the following inputs must be collected. Show the workflow for both.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Co-drivers: users can enter / connect with co-drivers to increase the consuming score.</li>\n\t\t<li>Mobility: traveling by train, bus, bicycle, etc (sustainable mobility) improves users score.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>We like the idea of giving users individual tips for improving their driving behavior to enable lowering the CO2 consumption. Where is the best place to do this? Home page? Another page? We think of another page just for tips, because then users can decide if they want them or not. If they are on the start/home screen some of our users may be distracted.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#FF8C00\">04. Progress</span>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Development of the consuming score (charts and statistics) to give an overview of the CO2 consumption over time.</li>\n\t<li>User can set parameters such as the period of consideration (week, month, year).</li>\n\t<li>Open to suggestions to show progress. Incentives play an important role in the improvement of the score.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>An important incentive for using the app and improving CO2 consumption value and score is the sustainable impact and the competition with other users.</li>\n\t\t<li>If you use &ldquo;saved trees&rdquo; as a unit for CO2 consumption score, this may be a strong incentive too.</li>\n\t\t<li>It&rsquo;s great to show progress because the number of saved trees is constantly growing. But we are open to ideas here.&nbsp;</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#FF8C00\">05. Saving Network</span>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Users are enabled to build up saving networks.\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Network improves score:\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>By motivating many people with good consuming scores to join your network to improve your score.</li>\n\t\t\t<li>Giving users an overview about how their networks affects their score</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>Users should see a number of how their networks affect their score &ldquo;your network improves your score by X points&rdquo;.</li>\n\t\t<li>User sees an overview of his network, can search for contacts on a search bar (user name) to compare scores (to single users or in groups)\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>Contact suggestions per connecting with phone contacts, Facebook.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>The network score must be the focus on this workflow (score for the collective efforts of the members of the network). How to present it? When? In which pages?</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>Your workflow must showcase:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>1) How to find a network (list? grid? suggestions based on location/score? search?).</li>\n\t\t<li>2) Search.</li>\n\t\t<li>3) Compare scores</li>\n\t\t<li>4) Action to join.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Screen Specifications</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Phone: 750px width. Height as much as needed.</li>\n\t<li>Make sure your work is in a vector format, for retina scaling and high fidelity.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Branding Guidelines</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Use a logo placeholder.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Follow the branding document for style, colors, and typography.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Design Assets</strong><br />\nFolder: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=16UKxZYVCwAwrq9ELbEFb1HWXVPqnlmss\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=16UKxZYVCwAwrq9ELbEFb1HWXVPqnlmss</a>&nbsp;\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Branding: official guidelines for style reference.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Target Audience</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Young and sustainability-oriented car persons. They can be drivers, passengers or simply interested in helping.</li>\n\t<li>It&rsquo;s targeted to be launched in Germany first (US English language).

for driving more safe and CO2 saving.</li>\n\t\t<li>Children who want to act more sustainable oriented and motivate their parents to install the app for saving CO2.</li>\n\t\t<li>Parents of these children, who care more for their sustainable driving impact because their children motivate them to do so.</li>\n\t\t<li>People from all ages who are just interested in how much CO2 they are consuming and what it means if it&rsquo;s set in ratio (by our score).</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Judging Criteria</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>How well you plan the user experience and

Please submit whatever solution you have in mind that might fix this in a document (preferable with screenshots).<br /><br /><h2>Final Submission Guidelines</h2>Submit a document with instructions to fix the issue.","descriptionFormat":"HTML","projectId":24020,"created":"2020-02-06T03:37:05Z","createdBy":"Wendell","updated":"2020-02-12T16:40:59Z","updatedBy":"AutoPilot","timelineTemplateId":"140b24d5-5259-4449-bc1f-3780f3b01555","phases":[{"id":"cdf5b5a5-0ad0-4b31-99ef-cca99b88055d","name":"Registration","phaseId":"a93544bc-c165-4af4-b55e-18f3593b457a","duration":864000,"scheduledStartDate":"2020-02-07T20:45:47Z","scheduledEndDate":"2020-02-17T20:45:00Z","actualStartDate":"2020-02-07T20:45:47Z","actualEndDate":"2020-08-04T17:09:09Z","isOpen":true},{"id":"f3b2d11f-7b6e-4d1a-86b0-4d3901c50e64","name":"Iterative Review","phaseId":"003a4b14-de5d-43fc-9e35-835dbeb6af1f","duration":86400,"scheduledStartDate":"2020-02-09T17:28:53Z","scheduledEndDate":"2020-02-09T19:00:11Z","actualStartDate":"2020-02-09T17:28:53Z","actualEndDate":"2020-02-09T19:00:11Z","isOpen":false},{"id":"81b94bb3-2528-4f96-943f-b363654dd502","name":"Submission","phaseId":"6950164f-3c5e-4bdc-abc8-22aaf5a1bd49","duration":863700,"scheduledStartDate":"2020-02-07T21:09:25Z","scheduledEndDate":"2020-02-17T21:04:00Z","actualStartDate":"2020-02-07T21:09:25Z","actualEndDate":"2020-08-04T17:09:09Z","isOpen":true},{"id":"00480d7d-45ad-4cdc-b305-7a1bf3205e5a","name":"Iterative Review","phaseId":"003a4b14-de5d-43fc-9e35-835dbeb6af1f","duration":259200,"scheduledStartDate":"2020-02-10T03:06:36Z","scheduledEndDate":"2020-02-12T16:41:04Z","actualStartDate":"2020-02-10T03:06:36Z","actualEndDate":"2020-02-12T16:41:04Z","isOpen":false}],"terms":[{"id":"e3370508-a541-4b9c-b83f-3bad33dcca4c","roleId":"3eedd4a4-3c68-4f68-8de4-a1ca5c2055e5"},{"id":"e3370508-a541-4b9c-b83f-3bad33dcca4c","roleId":"318b9c07-079a-42d9-a81f-b96be1dc1099"},{"id":"e3370508-a541-4b9c-b83f-3bad33dcca4c","roleId":"ff556573-5da6-4392-b38c-08c1d7599c4a"},{"id":"e3370508-a541-4b9c-b83f-3bad33dcca4c","roleId":"e0544b94-6420-4afc-8f63-238eddc751b9"},{"id":"aaa50b65-fb27-44e1-8398-03d70ce4ac5a","roleId":"0e9c6879-39e4-4eb6-b8df-92407890faf1"},{"id":"11ad4ba8-c3ec-4cf9-98e6-c7f43a5bd89f","roleId":"cfe12b3f-2a24-4639-9d8b-ec86726f76bd"},{"id":"9ef9dec4-dddb-48c9-9cce-659db68bc5ac","roleId":"732339e7-8e30-49d7-9198-cccf9451e221"},{"id":"e3370508-a541-4b9c-b83f-3bad33dcca4c","roleId":"d663fc84-5c37-43d1-a537-793feffb7667"}],"startDate":"2020-02-07T20:45:47Z","numOfSubmissions":3,"numOfRegistrants":15,"endDate":"2020-02-12T16:41:04Z","currentPhaseNames":["Registration","Submission"],"registrationStartDate":"2020-02-07T20:45:47Z","registrationEndDate":"2020-08-04T17:09:09Z","submissionStartDate":"2020-02-07T21:09:25Z","submissionEndDate":"2020-08-04T17:09:09Z","prizeSets":[{"type":"placement","description":"Challenge Prizes","prizes":[{"value":100,"type":"USD"}]}],"tags":["IIS","Windows Server","Node.js","Other"],"groups":[],"winners":[{"handle":"harishchennupa","placement":"1"}],"metadata":[{"name":"allowStockArt","value":"false"}],"events":[{"id":3452,"name":"2020 Topcoder(R) Open","key":"tco20"}]},{"id":"38fad7a3-9706-49c3-8446-ae1a288f21f7","legacyId":"30114674","status":"Completed","track":"Development","type":"Challenge","trackId":"9b6fc876-f4d9-4ccb-9dfd-419247628825","typeId":"927abff4-7af9-4145-8ba1-577c16e64e2e","legacy":{"track":"DEVELOP","subTrack":"CODE","forumId":90423,"directProjectId":24401,"reviewType":"COMMUNITY","reviewScorecardId":30002133},"task":{"isTask":false,"isAssigned":false,"memberId":null},"name":"Mobie Movies API | Update Wrapper","description":"<p><strong>Challenge Objectives</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Update an existing nodejs api wrapper with additional endpoints</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Provide debug statements</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>Project Background</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The overall project is about creating an Amazon Alexa Skill for allowing users to know more about cinemas located near them and the movies playing in the cinemas</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>The skill allows users to also book movie tickets</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>This wrapper is essentially a nodejs module that calls apis.

Quantum UI Prototype Challenge","description":"<strong>Challenge Objectives</strong>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Build a UI prototype with 2 unique screens and a modal popup using Angular 8.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Project Background</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>For the purpose of this challenge, we need the community to help build the UI prototype following the provided design.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Technology Stack</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Angular 8</li>\n\t<li>HTML5</li>\n\t<li>Javascript</li>\n\t<li>CSS</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>API Integration</strong><br />\nAlthough the API is not ready yet, you need to implement simple controllers to fetch the data showing in the app from JSON files. We should be able to replace the JSON files with actual API calls to integrate the app with the backend without much effort so hard coded data is not acceptable.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Screen requirements</strong><br />\nBelow is the list of screens that are supposed to be implemented in the prototype, we are referring to the slides / pages from the PDF we provided in the forum. Please cross compare this with the design, and if you see any inconsistencies or have any questions, raise them in the forum for clarification / confirmation.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nScreens not mentioned below are NOT in scope.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Landing Page</strong><br />\nSlide #2 is the landing page of this prototype (slide #1 from PDF is not in scope).<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nOn this page:\n<ul>\n\t<li>The banner at the top is static, the UI needs to be replicated but the UI elements don&rsquo;t need to respond to user actions.</li>\n\t<li>A list of projects are shown, which may either have Pending or Approved status.</li>\n\t<li>The design indicates Approved projects</li>\n\t<li>The action icons for Approved projects are shown as disabled, this is a design mistake. They should be enabled as well because users can edit / submit / re-submit any projects.</li>\n\t<li>Pagination needs to work on this page.</li>\n\t<li>If the user clicks the action icon in a row, it will navigate to the details page (described in the next section)</li>\n\t<li>The &ldquo;Confirm unbilled efforts&rdquo; button is disabled until some projects are selected, then clicking the button would also navigate to the details page.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Details Page</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The banner at the top is static, the UI needs to be replicated but the UI elements don&rsquo;t need to respond to user actions.</li>\n\t<li>PDF slides #3 to #9 show different states of the details page. #3 is what the page looks like on entering.</li>\n\t<li>Please note the column consists of 3 different parts: columns &ldquo;Emp name&rdquo; to &ldquo;Effort&rdquo; are fixed to the left, Total column is fixed to the right, the other columns in the middle should be scrollable horizontally and there can be as many as 21 numeric columns there.</li>\n\t<li>The design of the details page only shows one project, but there could be multiple projects showing on this page, which needs to be implemented by this prototype.</li>\n\t<li>The header section allows users to filter results by project, date or free text input, see slide #4 from the PDF, these need to be implemented by the prototype.</li>\n\t<li>Clicking the Edit button will switch the page into editing mode, see slide #5 from the PDF, please note only the Revised unbilled efforts rows need to be editable.</li>\n\t<li>The total calculation should be done in real time for each editable row, and rightmost Total column will include both actual and revised unbilled hours.</li>\n\t<li>Each of the editable row has an icon that can be clicked on the right side. Once the icon is clicked, a popup will be shown to let users select a reason, see slides #6 and #7 from PDF. <strong>Please note that this icon is only enabled / visible if the revised total hours are different from the actual total hours.</strong></li>\n\t<li>When edits are saved, reasons can be viewed by clicking the icon, see slide #8 from PDF. Notice that the icon looks different when there&rsquo;s no reason provided vs reason provided vs in edit mode.</li>\n\t<li>Finally, the page can be submitted by clicking the Submit button, see slide #9 from PDF. On clicking Accept, the prototype should navigate back to the landing page.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>General Requirements</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Make sure you don&rsquo;t just copy &amp; paste code to create the UI, it&rsquo;s very important to maintain code reusability so that integration will be easier later. <strong>This will be evaluated in the scorecard as a major requirement</strong>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Do NOT use global z-indexes.</strong></li>\n\t<li>No errors with production build.</li>\n\t<li>The data to be displayed must come from local JSON files and cannot be hardcoded.</li>\n\t<li>The main content should have fluid width to fill all available space.</li>\n\t<li>Pagination should work whenever applicable.</li>\n\t<li>Must use Angular 8 and follow the provided design.</li>\n\t<li>The pages should clearly indicate invalid input data to users, for example: if a user tries to submit a page without providing a required text field, the textbox should be highlighted with an error message.</li>\n\t<li>Must follow Angular 8 best coding practices.</li>\n\t<li>You are expected to create a detailed README file including information on how to setup, run and verify your application.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>HTML Requirements</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>HTML should be valid HTML5 compliant.</li>\n\t<li>Provide comments on the page elements to give clear explanation of the code usage. The goal is to help future developers understand the code.</li>\n\t<li>Please use clean INDENTATION for all HTML code so future developers can follow the code.</li>\n\t<li>All HTML code naming should not have any conflicts or errors.</li>\n\t<li>Element and Attribute names should be in lowercase and use a &quot;-&quot; or camel naming to separate multiple-word classes (i.e.. &quot;main-content&quot;, or &quot;mainContent)</li>\n\t<li>Use semantically correct tags- use H tags for headers, etc. Use strong and em tags instead of bold and italic tags.</li>\n\t<li>No inline CSS styles- all styles must be placed in an external stylesheet.</li>\n\t<li>Validate your code- reviewers may accept minor validation errors, but please comment your reason for any validation errors. Use the validators listed in the scorecard.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Code Requirements</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Provide comments on the CSS code. We need CSS comments to give a clear explanation of the code usage. The goal is to help future developers understand the code.</li>\n\t<li>Please use clean INDENTATION for all CSS so developers can follow the code.</li>\n\t<li>Do not create a single .css/.scss file for the whole app. Each component should have its own stylesheet file.</li>\n\t<li>Ensure that there are no lint errors.</li>\n\t<li>All CSS naming should not have any conflicts.</li>\n\t<li>You&rsquo;re free to choose between CSS &amp; SCSS but you need to use flex instead of float.</li>\n\t<li>Follow a clean folder structure.</li>\n\t<li>Use CSS3 Media Queries to load different styles for each page and don&#39;t build different pages for different devices / layout.</li>\n\t<li>Use CSS to space out objects, not clear/transparent images (GIFs or PNGs) and use proper structural CSS to lay out your page.</li>\n\t<li>Make sure npm run build works without any errors.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Javascript Requirements</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>All JavaScript must not have a copyright by a third party. You are encouraged to use your own scripts, or scripts that are free, publicly available and do not have copyright statements or author recognition requirements anywhere in the code.</li>\n\t<li>Use typescript and linter for code quality</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Licenses &amp; Attribution</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Third-party assets used to build your item must be properly licensed or free for commercial use. MIT, some modified BSD, Apache 2 licenses are ok, but if a library is not commercial friendly you need to get our approval first.</li>\n\t<li>Sufficient information regarding third-party assets must be present in your documentation. This includes the author, license info and a direct link to the asset online.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Browser Requirements</strong><br />\nWindows: IE 11+, Chrome Latest, Firefox Latest<br />\nMac: Safari Latest, Chrome Latest, Firefox Latest<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Documentation</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Design Source File</li>\n\t<li>PDF with screenshots of design</li>\n</ul>\n<br

The data sets that you propose don&rsquo;t need to be in the form where we can just pull out the insights directly - it is ok if we would need to use some forecasting, modeling or learning based on that data to ultimately get new insights - this has to clearly be described in your submission (no actual data science algorithms/models are needed at this stage - it is sufficient to explain that for example it is required to use the crawled data to forecast some useful value - building such forecast would be the scope of a future challenge, but still the expectations from the proposal should be realistic). Also, don&#39;t limit your proposals to ideas that are &quot;easy&quot; to implement - it&#39;s totally fine to include ideas where we would need to put a lot of effort and detail into actually implementing what you proposed, but make sure you clearly describe the benefits and expected outcomes.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial; font-size:10pt\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Note that you will likely need to first read a lot about the infant nutrition industry to get some sense of product types, major brands, trends, etc.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">To get you started, here are some data sources and models that could be used:</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">White papers from WHO, United Nations for Health, Children</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">World Economic Forum whitepapers or news&nbsp; impacting/influencing Malnutrition and related Health Challenges and inputs to mitigate that</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">NLP &amp; other analytical models for converting raw data into structured information, and insights generated from these comprehensive unstructured data sets as above</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Text Analytics to come up with Infant nutrition aligned &#39;Sentiment Analysis&#39;</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Identifying brands and correlation from text scraped from the web. e.g. of brands can be Beech-Nut and Del Monte Foods etc</span></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial; font-size:10pt\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Here are some examples of data source types that you can use (but the list is by no means exhaustive and you&rsquo;re not limited to items on the list)</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Customer data - Product reviews, social media, discussion boards, blogs</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Sales - online, retail</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Product - label data, product launches</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Technology - Clinical trials, global patents, research papers, grants</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Events - Conferences, Business news, funding</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Influencer &amp; KOL activities</span></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial; font-size:10pt\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<h1><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:20pt\">Checkpoint submission</span></h1>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Since this is an open-ended challenge, we have a checkpoint submission deadline on Jan 28th 9 AM EST.

Lacking skillful sub-seasonal information limits water managers&rsquo; ability to prepare for shifts in hydrologic regimes and can pose major threats to their ability to manage the valuable resource.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The challenge of sub-seasonal forecasting encompasses the lead times of 15 to 45 days into the future, which lay between those of weather forecasting (i.e. up to 15 days, where initial ocean and atmospheric conditions matter most) and seasonal to longer-lead climate forecasting (i.e. beyond 45 days, where slowly varying earth system conditions matter most, such as sea surface temperatures, soil moisture, snow pack).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The Rodeo II Challenge series is a continuation of&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.drought.gov/drought/sub-seasonal-climate-forecast-rodeo\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Sub-Seasonal Climate Forecast Rodeo I</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">&nbsp;contest.

The primary component of Rodeo I was a year of submitting forecasts every 2 weeks in real-time. Teams were ranked on their performance over the year and needed to outperform two benchmark forecasts from&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">NOAA</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">.

Each track will be split into 26 sprints, with each sprint lasting 2 weeks. There will be separate prizes for each sprint. There will also be quarterly and overall (annual) bonus prizes. To be eligible for the quarterly and annual prizes, you must outperform both the winning solution for that category from Rodeo I and a sub-seasonal forecast from NOAA.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Prize Structure</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;

All participants in a team must individually register for this Competition and accept its Terms and Conditions prior to joining the team. Team Captains must apportion prize distribution percentages for each teammate on the Teaming Form. The sum of all prize portions must equal 100%. The minimum permitted size of a team is 1 member, with no upper limit. However, our teaming form only allows up to 10 members in a team. If you have more than 10 members in your team, please email us directly at support@topcoder.com and we will register your team. Only team Captains may submit a solution to the Competition. Notwithstanding Topcoder rules and conditions to the contrary, solutions submitted by any Topcoder member who is a member of a team on this challenge but is not the Captain of the team are not permitted, are ineligible for award, may be deleted, and may be grounds for dismissal of the entire team from the challenge. The deadline for forming teams is 11:59pm ET on the 14th day following the start date of each scoring period. Topcoder will prepare a Teaming Agreement for each team that has completed the Topcoder Teaming Form, and distribute it to each member of the team. Teaming Agreements must be electronically signed by each team member to be considered valid. All Teaming Agreements are void, unless electronically signed by all team members by 11:59pm ET of the 21st day following the start date of each scoring period. Any Teaming Agreement received after this period is void. Teaming Agreements may not be changed in any way after signature.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Relinquish - Topcoder is allowing registered competitors or teams to &quot;relinquish&quot;. Relinquishing means the member or team will compete, and we will score their solution, but they will not be eligible for a prize. Once a competitor or team relinquishes, we post their name to a forum thread labeled &quot;Relinquished Competitors&quot;.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Use the match forum to ask general questions or report problems, but please do not post comments and questions that reveal information about the problem itself or possible solution techniques.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">In this match you may use any programming language and libraries, including commercial solutions, provided Topcoder is able to run it free of any charge. You may also use open source languages and libraries, with the restrictions listed in the next section below. If your solution requires licenses, you must have these licenses and be able to legally install them in a testing VM (see &ldquo;Requirements to Win a Prize&rdquo; section).

Here&rsquo;s a <a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/thrive/articles/How%20to%20use%20the%20Topcoder%20GUI%20KIT\">tutorial</a> on how to use the GUI KIT. Pay attention on how we use the typography on the banners and on the content area, how we add the photos (which are now all blobs), how we display cards, etc. If you are not clear about these, feel free to ask in the challenge forum.<br />\n<br />\nThe pages that need to be updated are all live on site, and you can use the same content.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>1. Member Stories:</strong><br />\nLink: <a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/community/stories\">https://www.topcoder.com/community/stories</a><br />\nThis page is showing stories of different members and how Topcoder has changed their life. The page is pretty long now. Think how can you apply the existing GUI KIT to make the page look better and more exciting. Any idea how to make it more compact?<br />\n<br />\n<strong>2. Member Programs</strong><br />\nLink: <a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/community/member-programs\">https://www.topcoder.com/community/member-programs</a><br />\nHere you can see a list of the active programs Topcoder has. This can be a series of challenges or a tournament or the MVP programs, etc. The page is split into 2 sections:&nbsp; Hot Programs and Active Programs: each has specific content and descriptions.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>3. Working Moms</strong><br />\nLink: <a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/lp/working-moms\">https://www.topcoder.com/lp/working-moms</a><br />\nThis page shows how a mom can work at Topcoder&nbsp; and what the benefits of it are. There are several sections here and we would like to keep all of them in the new design:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Topcoder for Working Moms</li>\n\t<li>Topcoder Allows You To</li>\n\t<li>What&nbsp; is Topcoder</li>\n\t<li>Topcoder is More Than a Company</li>\n\t<li>What Can You Do at Topcoder</li>\n\t<li>Still Have Questions</li>\n\t<li>Sign Up Today!</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>4. Newsletter Archive</strong><br />\nLink: <a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/community/newsletterarchive\">https://www.topcoder.com/community/newsletterarchive</a><br />\nOver the years we have had various newsletter types for different tracks: design, development, and data science. Now we plan to add one newsletter per month only, we will call it the General Newsletter, so in addition to those newsletters that you see there, we should also include the general one.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>5. Statistics Design</strong><br />\nLink: <a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/community/statistics/design\">https://www.topcoder.com/community/statistics/design</a><br />\nThis page contains tables with various information about designers performance. In addition to updating the tables design, think about how you can make them more exciting for the user. Is there any other way to display data without tables? We&rsquo;re open to your suggestions.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>6. Contact</strong><br />\nLink: <a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/community/contact\">https://www.topcoder.com/community/contact</a><br />\nWe&rsquo;re showing here different ways how the members can reach Topcoder support or how they can connect with other members.

If you submit the same bug in multiple areas/pages, (for instance, Same validation issue of a form can be found in different pages/sections) you will likely get credit for the original bug report only. The others will all be closed as duplicates.</li>\n\t<li>If you duplicate an issue on a different platform that hasn&rsquo;t been tested yet, you should create a new issue and add a link/reference in the issue comments section about the Original issue number. Our copilot will review these items and consolidate them later. Please don&rsquo;t make adjustments or change labels of existing issues logged by other competitors.</li>\n\t<li>DON&#39;T RE-OPEN the issues closed by reviewer and anyone who RE-OPENS a ticket will be disqualified from the challenge.</li>\n\t<li>DON&#39;T EDIT OR ATTACH FILES to the issues <u><strong>once it has been submitted</strong></u> and anyone who is doing this will be disqualified from the challenge.</li>\n\t<li>You must not edit the bug report once created, so make sure you enter all the details at the time you create the issue, otherwise, your issue will be moved to the end of the queue. If you really need to edit an issue you must use the comments section for this (i.e. add a comment to describe any changes you want to make to the issue), and we&#39;ll decide whether the changes are major enough to move the issue to the end of the queue.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>You must specify the test data you have used in the &#39;Reproduction Steps&#39;, All the issues will be marked as &#39;Incomplete&#39;, if the correct test data is not provided.</li>\n\t<li><strong>There will be no appeals phase. The decision of PM/Copilot for validity and severity of each filed issue will be final.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Issue Weight and Scoring:</h4>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Scoring will be based on the number of bugs by weight. Be sure to correctly attach a weight to your bug.</li>\n\t<li>The review team has the right to change a issue category, priority and severity at their discretion.</li>\n\t<li>Only verified issues by reviewer and accepted by client will be counted. Duplicate issues will be closed and not counted.</li>\n\t<li>Log issues according to the guidelines above. Issues that do not follow these guidelines may reject due to lack of information.</li>\n\t<li>For challenge scoring, the user with the most verified issues/points will be selected as the winner. If two users submit the same issue, the user that submitted the issue first will receive credit.</li>\n\t<li>For any suggestions or improvements, please create separate issues.</li>\n\t<li>The following points will be awarded as per issue category:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Functional Issues: 10 Points</li>\n\t\t<li>Security Issues: 10 Points</li>\n\t\t<li>User Interface Issues: 5 Points</li>\n\t\t<li>Usability/UX/Suggestion/Improvements: 2 Points</li>\n\t\t<li>Content Issues: 1 Point</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>The placement points will be calculated after receiving client feedback with accepted bugs only. The client rejected bugs like Duplicate bugs will receive 5 Points penalty per bug where as by design, no repro, not a bug, on hold bugs will receive no penalty.</li>\n\t<li><u><strong>The 1st and 2nd place submissions must raise&nbsp;at least 10 client accepted bugs (at least 3 client accepted bugs from each platform Android, iOS, Web/Desktop) and at least total client accepted bugs worth 80 points.</strong></u></li>\n\t<li><u><strong>The 3rd, 4th and 5th place submissions must raise&nbsp;at least 10 client accepted bugs (at least 3 client accepted bugs from each platform Android, iOS, Web/Desktop) and at least total client accepted bugs worth 60 points.</strong></u></li>\n\t<li><u><strong>In case, no participants qualify for the placement prizes as per above rule, then one winner will be selected who have scored highest points after reviewers accepted bugs.</strong></u></li>\n\t<li>For challenge scoring, the user with the maximum points will be selected as the winner. Submitters that do not take 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th place will be <u><strong>Paid $1 Per Earned Point</strong></u> for each client accepted bugs up to a maximum of the 5th place prize. If two users submit the same points, then user that submitted the client accepted bug first will receive credit.</li>\n\t<li><u><strong>Duplicate/Rejected Bugs Reporting</strong></u>: If you log/report any duplicate bug during review phase and after client review feedback, then you will receive penalty 5 Points per duplicate bug regardless of Bug type. If you log/report any bug without required information (insufficient info on bugs or missing repro steps or missing screenshot or missing video, etc.), then you will receive penalty 5 Points per rejected bug regardless of Bug type.</li>\n</ul>\n<br /><br /><h2>Final Submission Guidelines</h2>Create and submit all your bugs with following details directly to Jira project.\n<ul>\n\t<li>Bug report as per Jira format</li>\n\t<li>Videos for bug reproduction steps</li>\n\t<li>Screenshot of bug with highlighting the issue</li>\n\t<li>App log files of bug</li>\n\t<li>Screenshot of your device information</li>\n</ul>\nWhen you are done with your submissions please submit a .txt file using the &quot;Submit&quot; button before the submission phase ends.

scoring marathon matches.</p>\n\n<p>This processor listens to our event bus for submissions, grabs the zip file for the submission, and then turns the submission into a docker image. It then runs the image as a container and produces outputs that a scoring function processes in another container.</p>\n\n<p>At the end a score is produced. Then send the score and the requisite metadata back to the review API for that submission with its score and details.</p>\n\n<p>We would like to adopt SageMaker to replace current solution.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Technology Stack</strong></h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Node 10</li>\n\t<li>Nodejs AWS SDK</li>\n\t<li>Docker</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><strong>Challenge Assets</strong></h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>One kafka processor codebase</li>\n\t<li>Sample submission code</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><strong>Individual requirements</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Here is the sample of one message in kafka</p>\n\n<pre>\n{\n  &quot;topic&quot;: &quot;submission.notification.aggregate&quot;,\n  &quot;originator&quot;: &quot;me&quot;,\n  &quot;timestamp&quot;: &quot;2020-01-21T00:01:00.000Z&quot;,\n  &quot;mime-type&quot;: &quot;application/json&quot;,\n  &quot;payload&quot;: {\n\t  &quot;resource&quot;: &quot;review&quot;,\n\t  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;f3c3f4e3-6384-4042-a093-bac85d1dda81&quot;,\n\t  &quot;created&quot;: &quot;2020-01-21T00:48:26.870Z&quot;,\n\t  &quot;updated&quot;: &quot;2020-01-21T00:48:26.870Z&quot;,\n\t  &quot;createdBy&quot;: &quot;mL4037GVeLQOvb8TgU4KW38mlevpfp4y@clients&quot;,\n\t  &quot;updatedBy&quot;: &quot;mL4037GVeLQOvb8TgU4KW38mlevpfp4y@clients&quot;,\n\t  &quot;status&quot;: &quot;completed&quot;,\n\t  &quot;score&quot;: 100,\n\t  &quot;reviewerId&quot;: &quot;b8ff717c-d098-487e-a61f-4e40c7595a65&quot;,\n\t  &quot;submissionId&quot;: &quot;d01c8c8b-2a7f-463f-992b-7bc5423e1dd0&quot;,\n\t  &quot;scoreCardId&quot;: 30001850,\n\t  &quot;typeId&quot;: &quot;55bbb17d-aac2-45a6-89c3-a8d102863d05&quot;,\n\t  &quot;originalTopic&quot;: &quot;submission.notification.create&quot;\n  }\n}</pre>\n\n<p><strong>1.

If you successfully complete multiple sets of test cases, then you will be awarded a prize for each one completed.</li>\n\t<li>If you execute a test case and miss an issue that is found by the reviewer, then you are on risk losing payment for that test case. It requires you to be thorough in testing and show clear verification steps in the video.</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#FF0000\">For incomplete submissions or tickets/bugs having review feedback will receive penalty on ticket price. This will reduce 10%, 25%, 50% of ticket price for each failed submission and 50% is the most deduced price. So it is recommended to read the shared document carefully and submit the report with all necessary information without fail.</span></li>\n\t<li>The challenge submission that was scored more number of&nbsp;accepted tickets after review by reviewers on Jira wins and in case of tie on accepted number of tickets, then the challenge submission that was uploaded earlier wins.</li>\n</ul>\n<br /><br /><h2>Final Submission Guidelines</h2><div>Your final deliverable for each ticket is as mentioned below:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Provid required info details on each ticket when you complete the test case ticket execution on Jira</li>\n\t<li>Videos for all&nbsp;Test Case steps and also bug videos for the repoduction steps</li>\n\t<li>Screenshot of bug with highlighting the issue</li>\n\t<li>The app log files for each test case</li>\n\t<li>Screenshot of your device information</li>\n</ul>\nWhen you are done with your reporting, please submit a .txt file in Direct using the &quot;Submit&quot; button before the submission phase ends.

If you submit the same bug in multiple areas/pages, (for instance, Same validation issue of a form can be found in different pages/sections) you will likely get credit for the original bug report only. The others will all be closed as duplicates.</li>\n\t<li>If you duplicate an issue on a different platform that hasn&rsquo;t been tested yet, you should create a new issue and add a link/reference in the issue comments section about the Original issue number. Our copilot will review these items and consolidate them later. Please don&rsquo;t make adjustments or change labels of existing issues logged by other competitors.</li>\n\t<li>DON&#39;T RE-OPEN the issues closed by reviewer and anyone who RE-OPENS a ticket will be disqualified from the challenge.</li>\n\t<li>DON&#39;T EDIT OR ATTACH FILES to the issues <u><strong>once it has been submitted</strong></u> and anyone who is doing this will be disqualified from the challenge.</li>\n\t<li>You must not edit the bug report once created, so make sure you enter all the details at the time you create the issue, otherwise, your issue will be moved to the end of the queue. If you really need to edit an issue you must use the comments section for this (i.e. add a comment to describe any changes you want to make to the issue), and we&#39;ll decide whether the changes are major enough to move the issue to the end of the queue.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>You must specify the test data you have used in the &#39;Reproduction Steps&#39;, All the issues will be marked as &#39;Incomplete&#39;, if the correct test data is not provided.</li>\n\t<li><strong>There will be no appeals phase. The decision of PM/Copilot for validity and severity of each filed issue will be final.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Issue Weight and Scoring:</h4>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Scoring will be based on the number of bugs by weight. Be sure to correctly attach a weight to your bug.</li>\n\t<li>The review team has the right to change a issue category, priority and severity at their discretion.</li>\n\t<li>Only verified issues by reviewer and accepted by client will be counted. Duplicate issues will be closed and not counted.</li>\n\t<li>Log issues according to the guidelines above. Issues that do not follow these guidelines may reject due to lack of information.</li>\n\t<li>For challenge scoring, the user with the most verified issues/points will be selected as the winner. If two users submit the same issue, the user that submitted the issue first will receive credit.</li>\n\t<li>For any suggestions or improvements, please create separate issues.</li>\n\t<li>The following points will be awarded as per issue category:\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Functional Issues: 10 Points</li>\n\t\t<li>Security Issues: 10 Points</li>\n\t\t<li>User Interface Issues: 5 Points</li>\n\t\t<li>Usability/UX/Suggestion/Improvements: 2 Points</li>\n\t\t<li>Content Issues: 1 Point</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>The placement points will be calculated after receiving client feedback with accepted bugs only. The client rejected bugs like Duplicate bugs will receive 5 Points penalty per bug where as by design, no repro, not a bug, on hold bugs will receive no penalty.</li>\n\t<li><u><strong>The 1st and 2nd place submissions must raise&nbsp;at least 10 client accepted bugs (at least 3 client accepted bugs from each platform Android, iOS, Web/Desktop) and at least total client accepted bugs worth 80 points.</strong></u></li>\n\t<li><u><strong>The 3rd, 4th and 5th place submissions must raise&nbsp;at least 10 client accepted bugs (at least 3 client accepted bugs from each platform Android, iOS, Web/Desktop) and at least total client accepted bugs worth 60 points.</strong></u></li>\n\t<li><u><strong>In case, no participants qualify for the placement prizes as per above rule, then one winner will be selected who have scored highest points after reviewers accepted bugs.</strong></u></li>\n\t<li>For challenge scoring, the user with the maximum points will be selected as the winner. Submitters that do not take 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th place will be <u><strong>Paid $1 Per Earned Point</strong></u> for each client accepted bugs up to a maximum of the 5th place prize. If two users submit the same points, then user that submitted the client accepted bug first will receive credit.</li>\n\t<li><u><strong>Duplicate/Rejected Bugs Reporting</strong></u>: If you log/report any duplicate bug during review phase and after client review feedback, then you will receive penalty 5 Points per duplicate bug regardless of Bug type. If you log/report any bug without required information (insufficient info on bugs or missing repro steps or missing screenshot or missing video, etc.), then you will receive penalty 5 Points per rejected bug regardless of Bug type.</li>\n</ul>\n<br /><br /><h2>Final Submission Guidelines</h2>Create and submit all your bugs with following details directly to Jira project.\n<ul>\n\t<li>Bug report as per Jira format</li>\n\t<li>Videos for bug reproduction steps</li>\n\t<li>Screenshot of bug with highlighting the issue</li>\n\t<li>App log files of bug</li>\n\t<li>Screenshot of your device information</li>\n</ul>\nWhen you are done with your submissions please submit a .txt file using the &quot;Submit&quot; button before the submission phase ends.

Forecasting - Financial Forecast Sandesh Brand 2","description":"<h1><strong>Background</strong></h1>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Over the last few months, a series of challenges have been run to generate a series of high quality financial forecasts for a consumer broadband brand.&nbsp; These challenges have been known as &lsquo;CFO Forecasting&rsquo; in various formats. As a result, a high quality, high accuracy series of algorithmic forecasts have been produced for 6 financial target variables.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">This new challenge is being initiated to generate a similar high quality forecast for a &lsquo;sister brand&rsquo;, owned by the same client, offering a similar but competitive consumer broadband product set.&nbsp; The models for the original broadband product set have been provided as a basis for a forecast for the &lsquo;sister brand&rsquo;, though these need not necessarily be used if a superior performance is achieved through a different algorithm.</span></p>\n\n<h1><strong>Challenge Objective</strong></h1>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The objective of this challenge is to generate the highest accuracy predictions possible for the 6 financial variables outlined below, for each of the two products.The accuracy of the forecast must at least improve on the Threshold target quoted for each variable / product.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The model should be tailored to a 12-mth forecast horizon but must be extendable beyond this time period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The accuracy of a prediction will be evaluated using MAPE error on the privatised data set over a period of 6 months.</span></p>\n\n<h1><strong>Business context</strong></h1>\n\n<p><strong>The two products are </strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">broadband products:&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Tortoise (legacy product, declining product, available everywhere) - slow download speeds.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Rabbit (main product, reaching maturity, available in most of the country) - faster download speeds.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">These two products do have an inter dependency since Rabbit product is an upgrade of the earlier version, with the product growth of the later version dependent to a large extent on upgrading the customers from the earlier version.&nbsp; There is therefore a gradual move from Tortoise to Rabbitt.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>The six variables are </strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">financial metrics</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11.5pt\">Gross adds</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\"> &ndash; the number of new subscribers by product joining the brand during a month</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11.5pt\">Leavers</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\"> &ndash; the number of subscribers by product who terminated service with the brand during that month</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11.5pt\">Net migrations</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\"> &ndash; the number of subscribers who remained with the brand but moved to another product.&nbsp; This usually is an upgrade to faster broadband speed.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(42, 42, 43); font-family:roboto,sans-serif; font-size:11pt\">These three &lsquo;discontinuous&rsquo; variables are seasonal; vary significantly from month to month; and are almost entirely dependent on the market, and competitor pressures at that point in time.</span></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Closing Base - the number of subscribers by product at the end of the month</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Average Revenue per user - the average monthly revenue paid by a subscriber per month for the service</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Revenue - the total revenue generated by the subscriber base per product per month.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(42, 42, 43); font-family:roboto,sans-serif; font-size:11pt\">These three &lsquo;continuous&rsquo; variables have a significant monthly recurring component with only small monthly incremental (both positive or negative) change.&nbsp; They are therefore smooth and continuous with only gradual shifts in the value..</span></p>\n\n<h1><strong>Challenge Thresholds and Targets</strong></h1>\n\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/95AgHiIjApCpkexsLhOzYXhvy6hXtnWi1Uk7TYjb0GRJh7-14AxJkjHQEeNzaAMIIz6AJ3rctSXtOqnVAM4c1ykVLCDWUPrgCm1tKKENJ7OnpEg8mAD0373TAKhqHYXYy5WGOtrd\" style=\"height:299px;

functional.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>PROJECT BACKGROUND</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>We are building an MVP of a mobile app that allows patients to schedule and participate in teleconsultations on their mobile device, and of a web app that allows doctors to view teleconsult schedules and participate in teleconsults from a desktop device.</li>\n\t<li>This MVP is the 1st phase of a bigger project, both the mobile app and the web app have a much bigger scope to be done later.</li>\n\t<li>For the purpose of this challenge, we are focusing on the integration of the web app.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>TECHNOLOGY STACK</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>ReactJS Latest

/>\n<strong>API INTEGRATION</strong><br />\nRight now the prototype is using local json data files, we need to get rid of these and integration the prototype with our backend API so it becomes fully functional.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nThere&rsquo;s currently no way to create physicians from the UI, so they need to be inserted directly into the database.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>SCREEN REQUIREMENTS</strong><br />\nThe following screens from the prototype must all be integrated with the API.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Login</strong><br />\nThis needs to be integrated with the login

redirected to this page. It needs to call the backend api to retrieve the appointments that belong to the user.</li>\n\t<li>Both upcoming and past appointments need to be shown.</li>\n\t<li>5 minutes prior to an appointment, the video call icon will become enabled (disabled by default) and clicking it will lead to the Teleconsult screen described below.</li>\n\t<li>Ignore the Patients and Calendar icons on the left sidebar (i.e. these two are static icons for now and should be grayed out by default)</li>\n\t<li>The rightmost sidebar is also static for now (already implemented)</li>\n\t<li>Search and notifications on top right corner don&rsquo;t need to work for now</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Teleconsult</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>For this page we only need to focus on the integration with Zoom SDK. Right now it hardcodes the logic to join an existing meeting. But instead we need to start a meeting on this page automatically and update the meeting id and password into the appointment through the backend API so that the mobile app will be able to pull the meeting id and password and join automatically.

Do NOT use browser alerts, but use custom styles popups as per prototype</li>\n\t<li>Show loading spinners when populating data from API / local JSON to UI</li>\n\t<li>Implement validation errors (for example: login error as shown in the prototype)</li>\n\t<li>No linting errors</li>\n\t<li>No errors with prod builds</li>\n\t<li>You are expected to create a detailed README file including information on how to setup, run and verify your application.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>CODE REQUIREMENTS</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>ES6 syntax is preferred, as Babel has been setup to handle transpiling the syntax to the current JavaScript standard.</li>\n\t<li>Use .jsx extension for React components; using PascalCase for filenames. E.g., ComponentName/index.jsx.</li>\n\t<li>Do not create a single .css/.scss file for the whole app. Each component should have its own stylesheet file.</li>\n\t<li>Ensure that there are no lint errors.</li>\n\t<li>You&rsquo;re free to choose between CSS &amp; SCSS but you need to use flex instead of float.</li>\n\t<li>Follow a clean folder structure.</li>\n\t<li>Create reusable components.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>JAVASCRIPT REQUIREMENTS</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>All JavaScript must not have a copyright by a third party.

We have a Developer Portal that can be used to register the Developer (using a Developer API Key).&nbsp; Since this will be multi-tenanted solution and there will be multiple Enterprises using our API/SDK we also register the Developers organization (using an Enterprise API Key) in the Developer Portal.&nbsp;

You are welcome to look at alternatives means of achieving this but have assumed that this can be implemented using the NGINX Ingress Controller.</span></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<p><strong>What can be assumed to be in place:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;

font-size:11pt\">There are iOS and Android SDKs which consumes the backend API.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">The SDK passes the OAuth token, ClientID and Enterprise API Key.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>What needs to be developed:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li><span style=\"background-color:transparent;

As issues are identified they need to be logged on Gitlab, you can find the link to the Gitlab page in the forum once you register.<br />\n2. Issues must include clear descriptions, test cases and steps to reproduce and expected vs. actual results in order to be counted.<br />\n3. The first competitor to find an issue gets credit, duplicates will not be counted.<br />\n4. Reviewers will accept, reject or mark the issues as duplicate.<br />\n5. Please DO take a look at the reported bugs, duplicated bugs cost your work time and the reviewer&#39;s time.<br />\n6. We&#39;ll decide whether a bug is valid or not based on our knowledge about the app,&nbsp;it&#39;s totally up to us.<br />\n7. Please thoroughly test the app and find all kinds of issues, however, we&rsquo;ll award different prizes for different types of issues (see the scoring section for details), the reviewer will decide which type each belongs to during the review phase.<br />\n8. Functionality testing must be based on the requirements,&nbsp;all bug reports based on your own assumptions will be rejected.<br />\n9. Our expectation from Members is that they will report bugs on different browsers/ platforms under the same ticket if they have means to test it. Members should not be creating separate tickets for the same repeating bugs for separate platforms/browsers. In such a case it&#39;s totally up to us whether to accept the bug or not.<br />\n<span style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 0)\">10. You must not edit the bug report once created, so make sure you enter all the details at the time you create the issue, otherwise, your issue will be moved to the end of the queue. If you really need to edit an issue you must use the comments section for this (i.e. add a comment to describe any changes you want to make to the issue), and we&#39;ll decide whether the changes are major enough to move the issue to the end of the queue. You are allowed to add screenshots in the comments section though, assuming your issue report contains all the details when created.<br />\n11. Differences between the application will count as bugs. Just keep in mind that iOS and Android has some different UI design, so some difference might not count. This will be decided during review.</span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Important Notice:</strong></p>\n\n<p>You must also be the first person to report the issue and submit it while the submission phase is open. &nbsp;GitLab will allow you to file issues before and after the submission phase, but these will NOT be counted.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Provided Resources</strong></h3>\n\n<p>The following documentation will be available in the contest forum:<br />\n1. Source code for both frontend and backend<br />\n2. Requirement documents<br />\n3. Deployed backend application</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Contest Prize Eligibility</strong></p>\n\n<p>The submitter with the most accepted bugs will win the contest.</p>\n</div>\n<br /><br /><h2>Final Submission Guidelines</h2><strong>1. Bug Report Process</strong><br />\n<br />\nBug Report Format<br />\n<br />\nFor each report of a limitation or bug, we need the following information:<br />\n<br />\n1. Steps to reproduce, including any needed information<br />\n2. Screenshots or Screen Capture (required)<br />\n3. Expected results after the bug are fixed<br />\n4. Current results, before the bug is fixed<br />\n5. Device version and OS version<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Important Notice:</strong><br />\n<br />\nIf you do not properly document your bug reports, they will likely be rejected due to a lack of information or documentation. Also, make sure your bug reports are reasonably general.<br />\nIf you submit the same bug that is seen in multiple screens, for instance, you will likely only get credit for the original bug report. The others will all be closed as duplicates.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>2. Ticket Logging</strong><br />\n<br />\nYou will log your tickets in the specified GitLab repo.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>3. Scoring</strong><br />\n<br />\nFor scoring, the submitter with the most accepted bugs will win 1st place.<br />\nFor submitters who submit but don&#39;t take the top place, if they submit bugs that aren&#39;t covered in the top 2 place submissions, they will receive a prize of $5 for each unique bug reported up to a maximum of the second-place prize.<br />\n<br />\nOur expectation is this member should file bugs for both Android and iOS, if he has means to do it. (Assumption is member filing the repeating bug, has not filed any matching bug for separate mobile devices already. In such a case we will reject it.)<br />\n<br />\nImportant Notice:<br />\n<br />\nIf two submitters submit the same bug report, the submitter who submitted the report first into GitLab will get credit for the bug. The second submitter will not.<br />\n&nbsp;\n<p><strong>4. Tips</strong><br />\n<br />\nSubmitting what is obviously the same issue multiple times with small variations will only annoy the reviewer that has to sort through all the issues and will only count as one issue anyway. If it&#39;s less obvious if it is the same issue or not, use your best judgment and the reviewers will do the same.<br />\n2. Put an eye on the issues being submitted by other members to minimize the time you may be spending on duplicate efforts. Knowing what has already been reported will allow you to better focus your time on finding yet undiscovered issues.<br />\n3.

BACKGROUND</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>We are building an MVP of a mobile app that allows patients to schedule and participate in teleconsultations on their mobile device, and of a web app that allows doctors to view teleconsult schedules and participate in teleconsults from a desktop device.</li>\n\t<li>This MVP is the 1st phase of a bigger project, both the mobile app and the web app have a much bigger scope to be done later.</li>\n\t<li>For the purpose of this challenge, we are building the UI of the mobile app.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>TECHNOLOGY STACK</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>React Native</li>\n\t<li>Redux</li>\n\t<li>HTML5</li>\n\t<li>Javascript</li>\n\t<li>CSS</li>\n\t<li>iOS</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>API INTEGRATION</strong><br />\nAlthough the API is not ready yet, you need to implement all actions/services required to fetch the data showing in the app from JSON files and storing the data in the Redux store.

sprint is part of the second phase of the Rodeo II Challenge, which follows after the previous marathon match</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">. Big part of the problem statement is the same, but there are also some major changes. It is not required that you took part in the previous marathon match to take part in this sprint.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Water managers need more skillful information on weather and climate conditions to help efficiently utilize water resources to reduce the impact of hydrologic variations.&nbsp; Examples of hydrologic variations include the onset of drought or a wet weather extreme. Lacking skillful sub-seasonal information limits water managers&rsquo; ability to prepare for shifts in hydrologic regimes and can pose major threats to their ability to manage the valuable resource.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The challenge of sub-seasonal forecasting encompasses the lead times of 15 to 45 days into the future, which lay between those of weather forecasting (i.e. up to 15 days, where initial ocean and atmospheric conditions matter most) and seasonal to longer-lead climate forecasting (i.e. beyond 45 days, where slowly varying earth system conditions matter most, such as sea surface temperatures, soil moisture, snow pack).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The Rodeo II Challenge series is a continuation of&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.drought.gov/drought/sub-seasonal-climate-forecast-rodeo\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Sub-Seasonal Climate Forecast Rodeo I</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">&nbsp;contest. In December 2016, the&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.usbr.gov/\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">US Bureau of Reclamation</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">&nbsp;launched Rodeo I. The primary component of Rodeo I was a year of submitting forecasts every 2 weeks in real-time. Teams were ranked on their performance over the year and needed to outperform two benchmark forecasts from&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">NOAA</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">. Additional prize eligibility requirements included a method documentation summary, 11-year hind-casts, and code testing.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The current challenge is the&nbsp;</span><strong>second</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">&nbsp;step in a series of contests that builds on the results of Rodeo I. This document is the problem specification of 4 &times; 26 (in total, 104) recurring data science challenges (sprints) that aim to create good quality predictive algorithms on weather data over the next full year.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">There will be 4 independent tracks (the same as in the marathon match) - in each you will be solving a specific task. Each track will be split into 26 sprints, with each sprint lasting 2 weeks. There will be separate prizes for each sprint. There will also be quarterly and overall (annual) bonus prizes. To be eligible for the quarterly and annual prizes, you must outperform both the winning solution for that category from Rodeo I and a sub-seasonal forecast from NOAA.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Prize Structure</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;

All participants in a team must individually register for this Competition and accept its Terms and Conditions prior to joining the team. Team Captains must apportion prize distribution percentages for each teammate on the Teaming Form. The sum of all prize portions must equal 100%. The minimum permitted size of a team is 1 member, with no upper limit. However, our teaming form only allows up to 10 members in a team. If you have more than 10 members in your team, please email us directly at support@topcoder.com and we will register your team. Only team Captains may submit a solution to the Competition. Notwithstanding Topcoder rules and conditions to the contrary, solutions submitted by any Topcoder member who is a member of a team on this challenge but is not the Captain of the team are not permitted, are ineligible for award, may be deleted, and may be grounds for dismissal of the entire team from the challenge. The deadline for forming teams is 11:59pm ET on the 14th day following the start date of each scoring period. Topcoder will prepare a Teaming Agreement for each team that has completed the Topcoder Teaming Form, and distribute it to each member of the team. Teaming Agreements must be electronically signed by each team member to be considered valid. All Teaming Agreements are void, unless electronically signed by all team members by 11:59pm ET of the 21st day following the start date of each scoring period. Any Teaming Agreement received after this period is void. Teaming Agreements may not be changed in any way after signature.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Relinquish - Topcoder is allowing registered competitors or teams to &quot;relinquish&quot;.

GROW Educational Platform Design Challenge","description":"Welcome to the &quot;<strong>[FAST] GROW Educational Platform Design Challenge</strong>&quot;. In this challenge we are looking to get your awesome ideas for 3 screens for a potential, US based leading educational publisher client&rsquo;s existing educational platform, GROW. Let&rsquo;s show them what Topcoder design can do in this fast challenge!<br />\n<br />\nRead the challenge specification carefully and watch the forums for any questions or feedback concerning this challenge. Let us know if you have any questions in the challenge forum!\n<blockquote>\n<p>We would like to inform you that we have just been upgraded to Marvel 3, which means that project assigning might take slightly longer. Please, don&#39;t leave your Marvel requests to the last minute as you might miss the deadlines! Thanks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<strong>Challenge Objectives</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Provide the best, frictionless user experience.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>3 screens only with a modern UI.</li>\n\t<li>Desktop designs in 1366px width</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class='roundLabel'>Round 1</h3>For Round 1 please provide all 3 screens for feedback along with hotspots on your prototype.\n<ul>\n\t<li>1. Instructor - My Courses Page</li>\n\t<li>2. Instructor - Course Section Home Page</li>\n\t<li>3. Student - Course Section Home Page</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class='roundLabel'>Round 2</h3>For Round 2 please provide all 3 screens along with hotspots on your prototype.\n<ul>\n\t<li>1. Instructor - My Courses Page</li>\n\t<li>2. Instructor - Course Section Home Page</li>\n\t<li>3. Student - Course Section Home Page</li>\n</ul>\n<br /><strong>Project Background</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Our US based client is one of the largest educational publishers on the market who also offer services on the same field. Thanks to the rapid technological evolution and to be able to keep up, our client continuously researches and develops adaptive learning technologies.</li>\n\t<li>Adaptive learning offers students personalised learning experiences based on their skills and uses data to determine how they can progress most effectively. With the help of these tools the student-teacher interaction becomes more engaged and effective.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>GROW has been introduced 10 years ago and since then it has helped millions of students to grow faster and easier so as their teachers to convey the material in a more engaging way.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>User Roles</strong><br />\nThe system has two types of users. In this challenge both are in scope.\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Instructor</strong>: In GROW a teacher can create courses (e.g. Psychology 101) and course sections (e.g. 2020 Spring) under the subjects he teaches. For each course section he can upload his syllabus, choose the textbook he wants to use from the client&rsquo;s database, create assignments and tests and view the performance of his students</li>\n\t<li><strong>Student</strong>: A student can sign up to the teacher&rsquo;s courses through a link, then he gets access to the course material with all the assignments along with a calendar where he can see deadlines for those. He can also see his results and progress in GROW</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Design Considerations</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>We would like you to think about the two user personas and design accordingly. Though it is just 3 screens it is important to understand that goals and aims are different for the two user types.</li>\n\t<li>We shared a couple of current screens. You don&rsquo;t have to follow any of those, they are only shared to make you see the numerous functions offered in the web app.</li>\n\t<li>We would like you to come up with a modern UI. Please think of what actionable elements are needed on these screens, and how to organise them to better serve the user.</li>\n\t<li>This is a profit oriented organization, so here and there there are links to offer printed copies of the books for students or additional tools to use for teachers.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Screen/Function Requirements</strong><br />\nPlease prepare the following screens for your submission.\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\"><strong>1. Instructor - My Courses Page</strong>&nbsp;<br />\nThis is basically the dashboard of GROW for teachers. Please refer to the attached material! In addition to the current content, what else you would suggest to be there thinking about this page as a landing screen and dashboard? Based on the current content we still would like to see the following data on the screen:</div>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Course names</li>\n\t<li>Course section names</li>\n\t<li>What subject does the course belongs to</li>\n\t<li>Main textbook (with or without cover)</li>\n\t<li>Additional books</li>\n\t<li>Additional smart learning services included&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Student registration deadline</li>\n\t<li>Link to the student roster&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Various other actions: refer to the screenshots to study these in order to be able to decide if you would bring them forward.</li>\n\t<li>A link to create a new course</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\"><br />\n<strong>2. Instructor - Course Section Home Page</strong><br />\nOn this page the teacher will see high level information and notifications regarding the current section. Please check the attached screenshot. How would you rearrange the information on this screen? Is there anything else you would include? Based on the current content we still would like to see the following data on the screen:</div>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Assignments list</li>\n\t<li>Textbook(s) used</li>\n\t<li>Additional tools used</li>\n\t<li>Link to the syllabus (or to upload it)</li>\n\t<li>Student performance chart (note, that there is a whole page concerning this, so only a small representation would be OK).</li>\n\t<li>The teacher&rsquo;s recorded lectures</li>\n\t<li>Bookmarks for the students</li>\n\t<li>A link to the student view of the section page</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\"><br />\n<strong>3. Student - Course Section Home Page</strong><br />\nThis is the screen which the student will see after selecting a course section in the navigation of the web app (so this is not the landing page in the student&rsquo;s case). Please analyse the current attached page, then considering the requirements, create your version. Current contents to include:</div>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Course and section name</li>\n\t<li>Navigation: currently the student can navigate to: his profile (along with messages, notifications), to his calendar, to his courses, and to his results. Also you should provide logout and support features.</li>\n\t<li>Assignments: these are links to the assignments the teacher created for the students.</li>\n\t<li>Instructor name</li>\n\t<li>Course materials:</li>\n\t<li>Books/reading</li>\n\t<li>Printed offers</li>\n\t<li>Tutoring</li>\n\t<li>Resources: these are links to other tools from the client</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Challenge Assets</strong><br />\nWe provide you assets in the forums.\n<ul>\n\t<li>Color codes of the brand are given.</li>\n\t<li>Existing screens are also shared on the forum.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Branding Guidelines</strong><br />\nPlease consider the below guidelines during your design process:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Only color codes to be used will be shared with you, otherwise you are free to choose fonts. Please use a placeholder logo and don&rsquo;t refer to the client in any way, other than written here.</li>\n\t<li>Stock photos and stock icons are allowed from the approved sources, as long as you declare them.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Target Audience</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Higher education teachers and students.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Judging Criteria</strong><br />\nYour submission will be judged on the following criteria:\n<ul>\n\t<li>How well you plan the user experience and capture your ideas visually.</li>\n\t<li>Overall idea and execution of concepts.</li>\n\t<li>How well you implement the challenge requirements.</li>\n\t<li>Creativity and ease-of-use is key to success as it must be engaging to users.</li>\n\t<li>Cleanliness of screen design and user flow.</li>\n\t<li>Out of the Box Thinking</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Final Deliverables</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>All original source files.</li>\n\t<li>Files should be created in Adobe Photoshop and saved as a layered PSD file, Adobe Illustrator, Sketch or Adobe XD</li>\n\t<li>Marvel prototype</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Marvel Prototype</strong><br />\nWe need you to upload your screens to Marvelapp.\n<ul>\n\t<li>Please send your marvel app request to pere.viktoria@gmail.com</li>\n\t<li>To be able to showcase your design to the client <strong>please provide hotspots</strong> on your prototype.</li>\n\t<li>You MUST include your Marvel app URL in your declarations.txt (in your marvel app prototype, click on share and then copy the link).</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Submission &amp; Source Files</strong><br />\nFinal Deliverables<br />\nFor submission you have to upload a zip file that contains the following 4 files:<br />\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Source.zip</strong> &ndash; All original source files.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">All source files of all graphics created in vector format in either Adobe Illustrator or any similar software should

Pooling Combinatorial Optimization Marathon Challenge","description":"<h2>Prize Distribution</h2>\n1st place - $5000<br />\n2nd place - $3000<br />\n3rd place - $2000<br />\n4th place - $1000<br />\n5th place - $500\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\nWe are looking for a scalable solution for assembling mortgage pools, a complex non-linear combinatorial optimization problem, which is some variant of the knapsack problem. The best solutions should allow for configurability in constraints, speedy results, and cloud microservice deploy-ability.\n\n<h2>Background</h2>\nA given bank might lend out a couple hundred mortgages to various home buyers. The bank typically wants to liquidate these loans by packaging and selling them to government entities such as <u>Fannie Mae</u> or <u>Freddie Mac</u> at a small markup. In this way, the bank not only makes money on fees and the markup, but also frees up these assets for providing more loans, and repeating the cycle.<br />\n<u>Fannie Mae</u> and <u>Freddie Mac</u> have <a href=\"http://www.mortgagenewsdaily.com/mbs/\">pre-defined pools</a> for creating their mortgage-backed securities, each of which has a price they are willing to pay to the bank for that loan. For example, <u>FNMA 3.0 December</u> shows a price of 10<u>1.38</u>, while <u>FHLCMC 3.0 December</u> shows a price of 10<u>1.44</u>, meaning that <u>Fannie Mae</u>&rsquo;s markup for their <u>December 3% coupon</u> is <u>1.38%</u> and <u>Freddie Mac</u>&rsquo;s is <u>1.44%</u>. It is in the bank&rsquo;s best interest to sell each loan for the highest price possible (i.e. sell into the pool which offers the highest price). Therefore, among these two pools, the bank should allocate the loan to <u>FHLCMC 3.0 December</u> because 1.44% &gt; 1.38%. (Underlines are added for a better understanding.)<br />\nThe price that a given loan can receive is further affected by the servicing rights owner. Additional restrictions and constraints exist in each pool and servicing combination, such that maximizing the total price obtained across all pool allocations is a complex optimization. The following sections will outline the optimization goal and constraints.\n<h2>Objective</h2>\nThe goal is, for each loan <strong><em>i</em></strong>, to choose a pool option <strong><em>j</em></strong> and servicer option <strong><em>k</em></strong> among <strong><em>i</em></strong>&rsquo;s list of eligible options, such that the total economic value the bank can receive across all the loans in question is maximized.<br />\nTotal Economic Value = \\sum{ <strong><em>Pijk</em></strong>&nbsp;/ 100 *&nbsp;<strong><em>Li</em></strong> }<br />\nwhere <strong><em>Pijk</em></strong> is the price of the pool+servicer combination <strong><em>j</em></strong>, <strong><em>k</em></strong> that mortgage <strong><em>i</em></strong> is assigned to, and <strong><em>Li</em></strong> is the <strong>LoanAmount</strong> of mortgage <strong><em>i</em></strong>.<br />\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Constraints</h2>\nThere are in total 18 constraints. As there are many formulas, please check this PDF: <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/1dpxw5ixd2ekatk/Constraints.pdf?dl=0\">https://www.dropbox.com/s/1dpxw5ixd2ekatk/Constraints.pdf?dl=0</a>.<br />\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Additional Requirements</h2>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>The constraint values c1 to c18 can be user-selected and passed in as inputs.</li>\n\t<li>Each of the constraints above must be configurable, i.e. can be turned on or off for a given run.</li>\n\t<li>Every loan must be assigned to one of its eligible combinations of <strong><em>j</em></strong> and <strong><em>k</em></strong>.</li>\n\t<li>The solution must output results <strong>within 25 minutes.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\n<h2>Data Description</h2>\nThere are three CSV files of data. Data can be found here: <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6pb7fnfil52mlbb/AADpT2TEbA23MDycfl1mGIMIa?dl=0\">https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6pb7fnfil52mlbb/AADpT2TEbA23MDycfl1mGIMIa?dl=0</a>.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nThe <em>Eligible Pricing Combinations</em> tab shows the available pool options <strong><em>j</em></strong> and servicing options <strong><em>k</em></strong> for each loan <strong><em>i</em></strong>, and the corresponding price. Each row is a unique eligible pool &amp; servicing option for a loan.<br />\nThe <em>Loan Data</em> tab contains relevant info for each loan <strong><em>i</em></strong>, including:\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>LoanID &ndash; unique identifier for loan <strong><em>i</em></strong></li>\n\t<li>LoanAmount &ndash; value of the loan, <strong><em>Li</em></strong></li>\n\t<li>FICO &ndash; credit score</li>\n\t<li>DTI &ndash; debt-to-income ratio</li>\n\t<li>HighBalFlag &ndash; identifies whether a loan is high balance or not</li>\n\t<li>PropOcc &ndash; Property Occupancy type indicator. Three types: Primary, Secondary, NOO</li>\n\t<li>PropState &ndash; Property State indicator. Assume all 50 states possible.</li>\n\t<li>PropType &ndash; Property Type indicator. Thirteen types: 2 Unit, 3 Unit, 4 Unit, Co-op, CondoHi, CondoLo, CondoMid, DetCondo, Manu, Modular, NonWarrantCondo, SFR_At, SFR_Dt</li>\n\t<li>Purpose &ndash; Loan purpose indicator. Three types: Purchase, Cashout, Rate/Term</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;<br />\nThe <em>Pool Option Data</em> tab contains type information for each pool <strong><em>j</em></strong>, including:\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Pool Type &ndash; indicates whether the pool is Single-Issuer or Multi-Issuer</li>\n\t<li>Pool Balance Type &ndash; indicates whether pool is Standard Balance or High Balance</li>\n\t<li>Agency &ndash; indicates whether pool is from Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Implementation</h2>\nYou must provide an interface taking the following parameters:\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>LoanData.csv</li>\n\t<li>PoolOptionData.csv</li>\n\t<li>EligiblePricingCombinations.csv</li>\n\t<li>Constraint.csv</li>\n</ol>\nAnd it outputs the final choices into a csv file, with 3 columns:\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>Loan</li>\n\t<li>Pool</li>\n\t<li>Servicer</li>\n</ol>\nYour solution must be a function which accepts as inputs: the dataset, values for the 17 constraints, and on/off flags for the 17 constraints.\n\n<h2>Scoring</h2>\nYour score will be the Total Economic Value, defined above. However, any solution that violates the constraints gets a score of 0. We provide the scorer for you to evaluate your solution locally.

/></p>\n\n<p><strong>Remark</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">This sprint is part of the second phase of the Rodeo II Challenge, which follows after the previous marathon match</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">. Big part of the problem statement is the same, but there are also some major changes. It is not required that you took part in the previous marathon match to take part in this sprint.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Water managers need more skillful information on weather and climate conditions to help efficiently utilize water resources to reduce the impact of hydrologic variations.&nbsp; Examples of hydrologic variations include the onset of drought or a wet weather extreme. Lacking skillful sub-seasonal information limits water managers&rsquo; ability to prepare for shifts in hydrologic regimes and can pose major threats to their ability to manage the valuable resource.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The challenge of sub-seasonal forecasting encompasses the lead times of 15 to 45 days into the future, which lay between those of weather forecasting (i.e. up to 15 days, where initial ocean and atmospheric conditions matter most) and seasonal to longer-lead climate forecasting (i.e. beyond 45 days, where slowly varying earth system conditions matter most, such as sea surface temperatures, soil moisture, snow pack).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The Rodeo II Challenge series is a continuation of&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.drought.gov/drought/sub-seasonal-climate-forecast-rodeo\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Sub-Seasonal Climate Forecast Rodeo I</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">&nbsp;contest. In December 2016, the&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.usbr.gov/\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">US Bureau of Reclamation</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">&nbsp;launched Rodeo I. The primary component of Rodeo I was a year of submitting forecasts every 2 weeks in real-time. Teams were ranked on their performance over the year and needed to outperform two benchmark forecasts from&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">NOAA</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">. Additional prize eligibility requirements included a method documentation summary, 11-year hind-casts, and code testing.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The current challenge is the&nbsp;</span><strong>second</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">&nbsp;step in a series of contests that builds on the results of Rodeo I. This document is the problem specification of 4 &times; 26 (in total, 104) recurring data science challenges (sprints) that aim to create good quality predictive algorithms on weather data over the next full year.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">There will be 4 independent tracks (the same as in the marathon match) - in each you will be solving a specific task. Each track will be split into 26 sprints, with each sprint lasting 2 weeks. There will be separate prizes for each sprint. There will also be quarterly and overall (annual) bonus prizes. To be eligible for the quarterly and annual prizes, you must outperform both the winning solution for that category from Rodeo I and a sub-seasonal forecast from NOAA.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Prize Structure</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The total sum of all prizes is&nbsp;</span><strong>$720,000</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial;

If you have more than 10 members in your team, please email us directly at support@topcoder.com and we will register your team. Only team Captains may submit a solution to the Competition. Notwithstanding Topcoder rules and conditions to the contrary, solutions submitted by any Topcoder member who is a member of a team on this challenge but is not the Captain of the team are not permitted, are ineligible for award, may be deleted, and may be grounds for dismissal of the entire team from the challenge. The deadline for forming teams is 11:59pm ET on the 14th day following the start date of each scoring period. Topcoder will prepare a Teaming Agreement for each team that has completed the Topcoder Teaming Form, and distribute it to each member of the team. Teaming Agreements must be electronically signed by each team member to be considered valid. All Teaming Agreements are void, unless electronically signed by all team members by 11:59pm ET of the 21st day following the start date of each scoring period. Any Teaming Agreement received after this period is void. Teaming Agreements may not be changed in any way after signature.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Relinquish - Topcoder is allowing registered competitors or teams to &quot;relinquish&quot;.

color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">. Big part of the problem statement is the same, but there are also some major changes. It is not required that you took part in the previous marathon match to take part in this sprint.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Water managers need more skillful information on weather and climate conditions to help efficiently utilize water resources to reduce the impact of hydrologic variations.&nbsp; Examples of hydrologic variations include the onset of drought or a wet weather extreme. Lacking skillful sub-seasonal information limits water managers&rsquo; ability to prepare for shifts in hydrologic regimes and can pose major threats to their ability to manage the valuable resource.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The challenge of sub-seasonal forecasting encompasses the lead times of 15 to 45 days into the future, which lay between those of weather forecasting (i.e. up to 15 days, where initial ocean and atmospheric conditions matter most) and seasonal to longer-lead climate forecasting (i.e. beyond 45 days, where slowly varying earth system conditions matter most, such as sea surface temperatures, soil moisture, snow pack).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The Rodeo II Challenge series is a continuation of&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.drought.gov/drought/sub-seasonal-climate-forecast-rodeo\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Sub-Seasonal Climate Forecast Rodeo I</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">&nbsp;contest.

The primary component of Rodeo I was a year of submitting forecasts every 2 weeks in real-time. Teams were ranked on their performance over the year and needed to outperform two benchmark forecasts from&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">NOAA</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">.

This document is the problem specification of 4 &times; 26 (in total, 104) recurring data science challenges (sprints) that aim to create good quality predictive algorithms on weather data over the next full year.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">There will be 4 independent tracks (the same as in the marathon match) - in each you will be solving a specific task. Each track will be split into 26 sprints, with each sprint lasting 2 weeks. There will be separate prizes for each sprint. There will also be quarterly and overall (annual) bonus prizes. To be eligible for the quarterly and annual prizes, you must outperform both the winning solution for that category from Rodeo I and a sub-seasonal forecast from NOAA.</span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Prize Structure</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;

Dashboard - DViz Design Concepts Challenge</strong>&quot;.</p>\nIn this challenge, we are looking to explore design concepts for a new Data Visualization Dashboard that will be implemented as a web report or using Qlik Sense. We are looking to design the data visualization experience to represent hierarchical financial information of multiple levels (5 levels at the very minimum). There will be different hierarchies for different financial entities.<br />\n<br />\nWe are really excited to kick off this new DViz Design Concepts Challenge.\n<h3 class='roundLabel'>Round 1</h3><p>Submit your initial designs for a checkpoint feedback</p>\n\n<p>- As a part of your checkpoint submission, you must upload your submission to MarvelApp so we can provide direct feedback on your designs.<br />\n- Make sure to include a URL/comment the link to your marvelapp while uploading your submission<br />\n- Make sure all pages have the correct flow!

Use correct file numbering. (00, 01, 02, 03)</p>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<br /><p>In this challenge, we are looking to design creative (and useful) data visualization dashboards that will be created as a web-report or using Qlik Sense.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Design Considerations</strong></span><br />\n- We are looking for a simple, easy-to-use, Informative, modern design.<br />\n- Try not to have too much information on your dashboard, you can make them compelling by making the visualization interactive and enable users to walk through or drill into the different insights.<br />\n- Use color, visual comparison, and drill-down charts to highlight comparison.<br />\n- Have your designs of size: 1366 x 768px<br />\n- Branding is open to the designers<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Required Dashboard Designs</strong></span><br />\nThe customer for whom we are building this UI/UX is a bank. The bank has further &ldquo;contracts&rdquo; with other financial institutions like other banks, financial institutions etc. Due to a new financial regulation raised by governments, these contracts have come under risk - some high risk, some medium, some low risk, some no risk (not affected by regulation).<br />\n<br />\nThe customer wants to build a dashboard where they can track these contracts. They want to see the total value of the contracts and how much of that value is at high risk, medium risk, low risk and no risk.<br />\nSince this is a dashboard, they want the ability to drill down the contract value by the various attributes of the contract.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>01 Dashboard:</strong><br />\n- We are looking for your help to design a dashboard that represents hierarchical Financial information of multiple levels (5 levels at the very minimum). There will be different hierarchies for different financial entities.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>FUNCTIONAL UNDERSTANDING:</strong><br />\nThese contracts have various properties.<br />\n-&nbsp;Bank Division: The division which has this contract<br />\n- Sub-division: The client with which the contract has been done.<br />\n-&nbsp;Client category: the Client can be assigned a category (Bank, Investment firm, financial institution etc.)<br />\n-&nbsp;Product type: Type of contract<br />\n-&nbsp;Sub product type<br />\n-&nbsp;Trade type &ndash; what is the trade type covered in the contract<br />\n-&nbsp;Contract END DATE (2020, 2021, etc. etc. )<br />\n-&nbsp;Contract Currency<br />\n-&nbsp;Contract value<br />\n-&nbsp;Many more attributes<br />\n<br />\nWe are looking to have 3 to 5 levels of hierarchies. We can expand each hierarchy with further attributes like currency (EUR, JPY, GBP, USD, CHF) or Trade maturity bucket (2020, 2021, 2023,2025,&gt;2025 etc).<br />\n<br />\nExamples of hierarchies are:<br />\n<strong>A. Divisional Exposure - Hierarchical structure</strong><br />\nLEVEL1: Bank Division (APAC, GM, APAC, SUB, IWM, Corporate Center)<br />\nLEVEL 2: Sub-division (GM Equity, GM Credit, APAC Markets, XVA, etc)<br />\nLEVEL3: Either Booking entity or Cluster (Booking entity is a bank or trading company. Cluster is a group of trading companies in a market)<br />\n<br />\n<strong>B. Counterparty Category - Hierarchical structure</strong><br />\nLEVEL1: Risk Category (High, Medium, Low)<br />\nLEVEL2: Client Category (Private Client, Hedge fund, Corporate, Bank, Clearing House, etc.<br />\nLEVEL3:<br />\n<br />\n<strong>C. Product Category - Hierarchical structure</strong><br />\n- LEVEL1: Product Type (e.g. Loan, Derivative, Inventory)<br />\n- LEVEL2: Sub product category (e.g. OTC Derivative, Cleared Derivatives, Bonds, Syndicated Loan, Corp Loans and Mortgages, etc )<br />\n- LEVEL3: Trade Type (e.g. IR Swap, Repo, IR Futures, IR Options, Mortgage loan, Corporate Loan, etc)<br />\n<br />\nProvide a way for the customers to run filters on the hierarchy.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>02 Hierarchy Management:</strong><br />\nProvide the ability to build their own hierarchical control by dragging and dropping from a master list of attributes just like we do in a pivot table in excel. Then the customer can save a version of the control for use next time and not have to build a tree-view control from scratch every time.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong>Reference:</strong></span><br />\n1.&nbsp;Customer has used a tree-view to represent three-level hierarchical information (<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1J16BPh0kHI7VvO9TEGh4CtST3j-u5lec\" target=\"_blank\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1J16BPh0kHI7VvO9TEGh4CtST3j-u5lec</a>)<br />\n2.&nbsp;The size of each node of the tree-view represents the dollar value of the node. The larger the dollar value, the larger is the size of the node.<br />\n3.&nbsp;Also different colors of the nodes (e.g. red, amber and green) would represent if the dollar value is at high risk, medium risk or low risk.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Important:</strong></span><br />\n- Keep things consistent. This means all graphics styles should work together.<br />\n- All of the graphics should have a similar feel and general aesthetic appearance.<br />\n- Focus on User Experience / how the user interacts within the dashboard<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>MarvelApp Prototype</strong></span><br />\n- We need you to upload your screens to the Marvel App<br />\n- Please send your Marvel app request to csystic@gmail.com (Challenge Copilot)<br />\n- You MUST include your Marvel app URL in notes /comments while uploading (in your marvel app prototype, click on share and then copy the link &amp; share it within your notes while you upload).<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Target Audience</strong></span><br />\n- CFO, Retail &amp; Corporate Finance Heads<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Judging Criteria</strong></span><br />\n- How well you plan the user experience and capture your ideas visually.<br />\n- Cleanliness of your graphics and design.<br />\n- Overall design, UI and user experience.<br />\n- Consistency across the UX/UI<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000FF\"><strong>Submission &amp; Source Files</strong></span><br />\n<strong>Preview Image</strong><br />\nPlease create your preview image as one (1) 1024x1024px JPG or PNG file in RGB color mode at 72dpi and place a screenshot of your submission within it.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Submission File</strong><br />\n- Submit JPG/PNG for your submission files<br />\n- Submit Marvelapp as part of your submission<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Source Files</strong><br />\nAll original source files of the submitted design. Files should be created in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, XD, or Sketch!<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Final Fixes</strong><br />\nAs part of the final fixes phase, you may be asked to modify your graphics (sizes or colors) or modify overall colors. We may ask you to update your design or graphics based on checkpoint feedback.</p>\n","descriptionFormat":"HTML","projectId":13107,"created":"2019-12-23T18:04:21Z","createdBy":"systic","updated":"2020-01-29T11:48:28Z","updatedBy":"ritesh_cs","timelineTemplateId":"4a59472b-0743-4dae-9739-1f5b327e1255","phases":[{"duration":172800,"scheduledEndDate":"2019-12-23T18:47:14Z","actualEndDate":"2019-12-23T18:47:14Z","isOpen":false,"name":"Specification

Make in-office appointments easier/more convenient to schedule</li>\n\t\t<li>2. Introduce telehealth/virtual care feature where patients wouldn&#39;t have to come into a physical clinic and could be seen by a doctor from the convenience of their own home via the app.</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>We&#39;re focused on current patients that already have a relationship with us.</li>\n\t<li>The output of this application will be used as a usability testing artifact (with patients), to aid in further requirements definition. We would like the Marvelapp prototype to mimic a production app as close as possible for continued research/testing purposes.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Design Goals &amp; Principles</strong>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Personalization is a tenet. Healthcare is deeply personal. Focus on the individual and THEIR experience. One of the practices we advise is to tailor the application to the individual based on the information we know about them. The user should feel the application is directly talking to them.</li>\n\t<li>We prefer a simple and clean design over complex and flashy.</li>\n\t<li>Photography and illustrations are both encouraged but lead with photography and support with illustrations.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<strong>Screens/Features</strong><br />\n<u>Note:</u><br />\nThese are skeleton requirements, brainstormed features simply to be used as inputs into this challenge. Feel free to come up with ideas and concepts for this mobile concept, we are open to alternative workflows and alternative features not listed here that would help the overall application. In terms of expectations, we would like to measure the concept against the following in the one to ten scales:\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Creativity: 7</strong><br />\n\t1: barely new ideas<br />\n\t10: a utopic product with features not proven to be able to be fully implemented</li>\n\t<li><strong>Aesthetics: 10</strong><br />\n\t1: low-fidelity design, wireframe or plain sketch<br />\n\t10: top-notch finished looking visual design</li>\n\t<li><strong>Exploration: 8</strong><br />\n\t1: strictly follow an existing reference or production guideline<br />\n\t10: open to alternative workflows/features not listed here that would help the overall application</li>\n\t<li><strong>Branding: 10</strong><br />\n\t1: don&#39;t care at all about the branding just functionality<br />\n\t10: without a properly branded product there is no success</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#FF8C00\">01. Home</span>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>There are login/register pages (out of scope) but authentication is not required to access the application content and features.</li>\n\t<li>Welcomes patients to the application.

We envision a new version of MS PowerPoint where users can work collaboratively on projects, using the power of the crowd (freelancers) to help people create the best decks out there.<br />\n<br />\nWe need your help to come up with high fidelity concept designs that showcase the features this application should integrate in order to create a frictionless path to success, from discovery to delivery experience.

Use correct file numbering. (00, 01, 02, 03).<br />The goal of this challenge is to design high fidelity concepts of the new MS PowerPoint web application which integrates a discovery and collaboration experience based on an available market of world workers (freelancers) who help with creating the best decks out there. In other words, making this existing application a crowd-based collaborative design tool.<br />\n<br />\nYou are provided with user stories and requirements to come up with your proposal.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>User Story</strong><br />\nMary is working on a Venture Capitalist pitch deck for her new ice cream business and needs this done in 2 weeks. Thankfully she is very connected. She reaches out to a large network of friends. Someone for content and research, someone for style and unique design, someone for grammar editing, someone to help with story-telling and finalizing the pitch and even a photographer to take images and add to the deck. Since she does not know how to project manage the deck herself she reaches out to her friend Bob to do the whole project manager, coordination.&nbsp; Everyone works together to make the deck happen while Mary focuses on making great ice-cream flavors. The result is a success.<br />\n<br />\nTypical users are not like Mary unfortunately and are not as connected as her. What if Mary didn&#39;t have this network? What if she was just a business owner and didn&#39;t even know who to contact and where to begin?&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Concept Design Goals</strong><br />\nThe goal of this project is to design a discovery, workflow, collaboration experience within the powerpoint app of how an army of freelancers around the world can be easily leveraged through the tool to make Mary&rsquo;s presentation a success. In other words, helping Mary to create a successful powerpoint pitch with the help of the PowerPoint and all of its great brand new collaborative features to help find freelancers, collaborate with them and project manage the project. The goal of this project is to design this workflow (what should it be?).<br />\n<br />\nIt&rsquo;s challenging to think of innovation for this scenario when there&rsquo;s no tool like this for a reference. When you see how iTunes, Spotify or Uber was created, you see how they took information and experiences to a completely new level by applying basic design principles as discovery, affordance, and feedback; magnified by the glorious benefits of modern technology to create what users didn&rsquo;t know they needed. Which is one of the most typical cases and that&rsquo;s why data from research is a key tool for coming up with features that will actually help users but they don&rsquo;t know yet.<br />\n<br />\n<u>Design Considerations</u><br />\n- We need you to think outside the box for this project, this concept is something new for users, so how would you make the features easy to use, easy to discover?<br />\n- We need to clearly see the necessary amount of screens and interactions to take Mary from point A (discover her options) to point B (playing her presentation pitch) in a frictionless way.<br />\n- Apply design principles that help with removing questions users might have during this experience. How would you make it self-explanatory?<br />\n- Think deeply what would the version of a collaboration PowerPoint would look like. Are there existing features that need to be removed? What&rsquo;s the most simple way to integrate the power of the world of remote workers into the application?<br />\n- How do you apply the design process to the creation of a PowerPoint deck? How would you integrate the research, content elaboration, visual design, and validation?<br />\n- We expect you to deliver between 15-18 unique screens, plus any necessary variations to help to showcase the sparkles of the interactions.<br />\n- Bonus: can you produce a video that showcases Mary&rsquo;s journey for the flow? That would be a significant asset for us to present the idea.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>About MS PowerPoint</strong><br />\nThe <a href=\"https://products.office.com/en-us/what-is-powerpoint\">latest version</a> of the online application can be resumed in a basic way as a presentation creation tool which allows the following (just FYI - this doesn&rsquo;t have to be represented in your user flow):<br />\n- Create presentation decks (from blank documents or templates).<br />\n- A deck can contain text, media files, micro-animations.<br />\n- There can be a transition between slides (fade-in, zoom-out, etc).<br />\n- Users can share projects and collaborate. See <a href=\"https://support.office.com/en-us/article/work-together-on-powerpoint-presentations-0c30ee3f-8674-4f0e-97be-89cf2892a34d.\">documentation</a>.<br />\n- You can access a free version of the online application <a href=\"https://products.office.com/en-US/office-online/documents-spreadsheets-presentations-office-online\">here</a>. You need to own a Microsoft account, that&rsquo;s the only requirement.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Screens Requirements</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#FF8C00\">Overall</span><br />\n- Propose a navigation system that makes sense and considers all the required features below.<br />\n- The following items are our initial rough proposal as a set of screens. You are encouraged to rethink and come up with what you think it&rsquo;s best for this project. Suggest how to organize this content and group them into screens that make sense. Note that maybe there&rsquo;s no need to separate engagement and collaboration flows. Help us!<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#FF8C00\">1. Welcome Screen</span><br />\n- What should the new PowerPoint first screen look like?<br />\n- Think about the process of engaging users to this new collaborative tool or features.<br />\n- The current version looks <a href=\"https://take.ms/DrTuG\">like this</a>. We would like to remind you that we do not care about the fact the design style doesn&rsquo;t match MS branding perfectly. We care about interaction and the ideas you can propose.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#FF8C00\">2. Discovery Flow</span><br />\nThere&rsquo;s a world of gig workers out there, our user needs to embrace them in the smoothest possible way. There could be several approaches to make this successful, overall, they all should at least fulfill the following considerations.<br />\n<br />\nProcesses:<br />\nAvailable areas or categories a deck design process needs to embrace:<br />\n- Content research<br />\n- Copywriting (pitch, storytelling experts).<br />\n- Stock icons and illustrations, stock photography/video.<br />\n- Graphic design (style, branding, typography system, infographics, etc).<br />\n- Animation (effects, transitions, micro-animations).<br />\n<br />\nFreelancers:<br />\n- User should be able to navigate through an available set of freelancers ready to jump into projects.<br />\n- There should be mechanisms for suggesting or filtering freelancers that best match the project requirements, with the goal of saving time.<br />\n- Freelancers should be somehow related to the specific design processes that happen within the elaboration of the deck, such as designer, copywriter, project manager, etc.&nbsp;<br />\n- How do freelancers become available, curated? Could they offer their help through tips or do work for free initially? If let&#39;s say Mary has a budget could she try 3 different freelancers at once for images and tip them? Can she invite same freelancers she liked before back? Or leverage freelancers her friends used before.<br />\n- There needs to be some sort of validation mechanism (reviews? rating? references?).<br />\n<br />\n<u>Considerations</u><br />\n- Difference pieces of the deck, slides will need different work, different freelancers. For example on slide 1 mary may want a perfect image of a grandpa with granddaughter enjoying ice cream. For this only slide 1 will need to be shared.<br />\n- Slide 2 she may want to outsource to someone to research the history of ice cream and its effect on bringing families together.<br />\n- She may want to outsource the whole deck to someone to polish the flow and create a perfect template.<br />\n- She may want to hire a VC storytelling expert to help her with her whole flow, the order of slides and what&#39;s needed. All of these capabilities, collaborations, taskifying will need to exist inside the powerpoint online tool.<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#FF8C00\">3. Engagement Flow</span><br />\nOnce the system has guided the user through the available suggestions/options, she needs to engage the community, to deliver requirements and set up the rules or agreements prior to start working/collaborating.<br />\n<br />\nRequirements:<br />\n- User should enter somehow the needs for the project. Mary may not know exactly what she wants and how to get to a perfect VC pitch and she needs someone to guide her through it using tooling inside powerpoint online.<br />\n- Amount estimated slides, goals, content mood (corporate, professional, peppy, etc), description, others - what could it be?<br />\n- Timeline and price should be defined and agreed.<br />\n<br />\nSelection:<br />\n- User should be able to define her collaboration team once all items are clear and set up.<br />\n- User should have a way to communicate with her team back and forth.&nbsp;<br />\n- How will the freelancer accept the offer?<br />\n- How will Mary request/accept the opportunity?<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#FF8C00\">4. Collaboration Flow</span><br />\n- We would like you to come up with the collaboration, task manager workflow that will address these problems. We face this every day in real world when we dedicate work to others. Workers may not finish it. Mary may not show up to work. A lot of this management happens in person, email, other tools. The goal is for all this to happen inside the app. What would be needed for Mary to outsource, find key workers? She may outsource a slide, a picture, whole slide deck or content. How can they collaborate with Mary and get her input? How will task scheduling work?&nbsp;<br />\n- User should be able to communicate with her available hired elements (either one or several).<br />\n- User should be able to review progress (through notifications maybe? approve, reject, comments, etc).<br />\n- There should be some sort of timeline of events that allows the user keeping track of things and progress.<br />\n- Design for error considerations:<br />\n-- How do you envision delays to be managed? Let&rsquo;s say photographer John delivered his assets 3 days late. It impacts costs, timeline and probably stresses Mary out. What should happen?<br />\n-- What if a freelancer goes out of the picture for whatever reason (blackout, stolen equipment, tsunami, etc). How to respond? Would there be penalties involved? Would it affect a possible rating system?<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#FF8C00\">5. Delivery Flow</span><br />\nThis is out of scope for this design exercise. However, you might find it useful as context, a global view of the whole picture. Do not design these screens.<br />\n<br />\n- The final PPT file should be easily accessible and the main deliverable asset the user will look forward to seeing.<br />\n- There should be a summary of the work made somewhere, which includes the final file (s), total cost, etc.<br />\n- There could be several payment models. Per task, tips, milestones. Maybe we can start with per task and based on the work? Freelancers will need to specify how much they can charge per job.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Branding Guidelines</strong><br />\n- Fonts and colors open to suggestions as long as they are inline with the design goals.<br />\n- There&rsquo;s no need to match the application look to any of the existing versions of MS PowerPoint. We DO NOT care about the look; instead, it&rsquo;s the interaction design we need to focus on.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Screen Specifications</strong><br />\nDesktop: 1440px width. Height as much as needed.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>MarvelApp Presentation</strong><br />\n- Request a MarvelApp prototype from me using this link: <a href=\"https://tc-marvel-app.herokuapp.com/challenge/30088255\">https://tc-marvel-app.herokuapp.com/challenge/30088255</a>&nbsp;<br />\n- Do not use the forums to request for MarvelApp.<br />\n- Provide clickable spots (hotzones) to link your screens and showcase the flow of the solution.<br />\n- Provide the MarvelApp shareable link in your notes during submission upload.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Stock Artwork (Illustrations, Icons, Photography)</strong><br />\n- Stock artwork is allowed for this challenge.<br />\n- Make sure to <a href=\"https://help.topcoder.com/hc/en-us/articles/217481408-Policy-for-Stock-Artwork-in-Design-Submissions\">declare all your assets</a> properly or you might fail screening.<br />\n- You don&rsquo;t want to fail screening? <a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/blog/ultimate-guide-pass-screening-design-challenges/\">Read this</a>.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Target User</strong><br />\nBasic business to large enterprises. We are figuring out our user specific features but we hope this will be a service that customer will want to pay for. Something easy and fun to use.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Judging Criteria</strong><br />\n- The novelty in the ideas you can suggest.<br />\n- How well you plan the user experience and capture your ideas visually.<br />\n- How well you implement the challenge requirements.<br />\n- Cleanliness of your graphics and design.<br />\n- Creativity and ease-of-use is key to success as it must be engaging to users.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Submission &amp; Source Files</strong><br />\n<u>Preview Image</u><br />\nPlease create your preview image as one (1) 1024x1024px JPG or PNG file in RGB color mode at 72dpi and place a screenshot of your submission within it.<br />\n<br />\n<u>Submission File</u><br />\nSubmit JPG/PNG for your submission files.<br />\n<br />\n<u>Source Files</u><br />\nAll original source files of the submitted design. Files should be created in Adobe Photoshop, XD or Sketch. Layers should be named and well organized.<br />\n<br />\n<u>Final Fixes</u><br />\nAs part of the final fixes phase you may be asked to modify your graphics (sizes or colors) or modify overall colors. We may ask you to update your design or graphics based on checkpoint feedback.<br />\n<br />\n<br

Similarly the review feedback needs to be resolved within 2 Hours, otherwise the ticket submission will be rejected and the ticket will be opened for pickup by others. <span style=\"color:#FF0000\">(Please prepare your submission very carefully before submiting it, the ideal case here is that your submission would be qualify for just one round of review then you don&#39;t need to worry about this 2 Hours rule)</span></li>\n\t<li>You will be awarded the listed prize amount for successfully executing the test cases for that test case and accepted by reviewer. If you successfully complete multiple sets of test cases, then you will be awarded a prize for each one completed.</li>\n\t<li>If you execute a test case and miss an issue that is found by the reviewer, then you are on risk losing payment for that test case. It requires you to be thorough in testing and show clear verification steps in the video.</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#FF0000\">For incomplete submissions or tickets/bugs having review feedback will receive penalty on ticket price. This will reduce 10%, 25%, 50% of ticket price for each failed submission and 50% is the most deduced price. So it is recommended to read the shared document carefully and submit the report with all necessary information without fail.</span></li>\n\t<li>The challenge submission that was scored more number of&nbsp;accepted tickets after review by reviewers on Jira wins and in case of tie on accepted number of tickets, then the challenge submission that was uploaded earlier wins.</li>\n</ul>\n<br /><br /><h2>Final Submission Guidelines</h2><div>Your final deliverable for each ticket is as mentioned below:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Provid required info details on each ticket when you complete the test case ticket execution on Jira</li>\n\t<li>Videos for all&nbsp;Test Case steps and also bug videos for the repoduction steps</li>\n\t<li>Screenshot of bug with highlighting the issue</li>\n\t<li>The app log files for each test case</li>\n\t<li>Screenshot of your device information</li>\n</ul>\nWhen you are done with your reporting, please submit a .txt file in Direct using the &quot;Submit&quot; button before the submission phase ends.

This property should only exist in phases associated with a challenge (</span><strong>Challenge.phases</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">). Add a new `</span><strong>typeId</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">` property (required) which is an auto-generated UUID.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Challenge API:</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\"> Update all related endpoints that create/update challenge phases (phases that belong to a challenge) so only the `</span><strong>typeId</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">` and the duration are passed and all other fields are populated/calculated by the API. You also need to update all existing validation that currently happens for phases.</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Challenge API</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">: In the phase object that&rsquo;s associated with a challenge (</span><strong>Challenge.phases</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">), we need to keep the `</span><strong>predecessor</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">` property that was removed (above requirement) and we also need to add a few new properties.</span><br />\n\t<span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">1. </span><strong>typeId</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\"> which is a required UUID.

Also, if the </span><strong>duration</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\"> of a phase is not provided, use the `</span><strong>defaultDuration</strong><span style=\"background-color:transparent;

This is the first stage of a series of challenges where we are looking into designing and building a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-label_product\" target=\"_blank\">white-label product</a> for an API marketplace solution that our client would like to offer for their financial institution clients like banks. The API marketplace would be used by the financial institutions (FI) to list their own APIs and third-party providers&rsquo; APIs as well for developers who will build applications, which will be offered to be used by the FI&rsquo;s customers.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nRead the challenge specification carefully and watch the forums for any questions or feedback concerning this challenge. Let us know if you have any questions in the challenge forum!<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Challenge Objectives</strong></u>\n<ul>\n\t<li>UI design for a responsive web app</li>\n\t<li>Understand the problem and come up with a great solution.</li>\n\t<li>Desktop screens of 1366px width.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class='roundLabel'>Round 1</h3>For Round 1 please provide at least the following screens along with hotspots on your prototype.\n<ul>\n\t<li>01 Developer Dashboard</li>\n\t<li>02 Marketplace</li>\n\t<li>03.01 API Details</li>\n\t<li>03.04 API Consumption</li>\n\t<li>04.02 Subscription Pricing</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 class='roundLabel'>Round 2</h3>For Round 2 please provide all the following screens along with hotspots on your prototype.\n<ul>\n\t<li>01 Developer Dashboard</li>\n\t<li>02 Marketplace</li>\n\t<li>03.01 API Details</li>\n\t<li>03.02 API Documentation&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>03.03 API Documentation Details</li>\n\t<li>03.04 API Consumption</li>\n\t<li>04.01 0Subscription Details</li>\n\t<li>04.02 Subscription Pricing</li>\n</ul>\n<br /><u><strong>Project Background</strong></u><br />\n<br />\nOur client offers IT and business process services worldwide for a large range of both leading and emerging businesses, among others for multinational banks. This time our client would like to build a white-label solution for these financial partners, which help them providing an API marketplace for their third-party API providers and developers.<br />\nWith the fast growing in the number of APIs (hundreds within an organization) and their availability from different sources makes it harder for application developers to find, and use them.<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Objectives of the Proposed Tool</strong></u><br />\n<br />\nThe goal of this tool is\n<ul>\n\t<li>to provide a one-stop shop for available APIs,</li>\n\t<li>to help API providers to list their APIs, and make it possible for them to monetize them on a subscription basis</li>\n\t<li>to help developers search for, find and connect to APIs from the same place with ease along with monitoring their API consumption.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<u><strong>User Roles</strong></u><br />\nThe system has 5 types of users. In this challenge only one, the developer is in scope.\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Super Admin</strong>: Out of scope. Manages all user and organization permissions. Can see reports of all levels.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Organization admin</strong>: Out of scope. Organizations are entities which are the employers of both the providers and the developers. The bank itself is an organization (internal) and the third party businesses are the external organizations. The Organization admin can manage the users within the organization, can manage the published and/or subscribed APIs, so as the applications they developed. He will be able to see the revenue statistics of the items.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Provider</strong>: Out of scope. An API Provider will be able to upload his APIs to the marketplace, set the subscription term and start selling them. He will be able to see the revenue and consumption reports of only his APIs within the organization he belongs to.</li>\n\t<li><span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong>Developer</strong>: In scope.</span> The developer will be able to search the marketplace for APIs and see the details of those. He will be able to subscribe to the APIs he&rsquo;d like to use in his developed application(s). He will be able to list his applications on the marketplace for the customers to download.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Customer</strong>: Out of scope. The customers will be the end users of the applications developed by the developers, using the APIs they subscribed for. They will be able to search for and download these applications.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<u><strong>User Story</strong></u><br />\n<br />\nDonald is a developer, who works for a travel agency. They would like to develop an app for the agency that will be offered to download by our bank (the owner of the API marketplace) and it would help people to book holidays. This app would offer weather forecast, contacting the agency, payments etc. To be able to include all the functions, Donald will need APIs to handle everything the app needs. Initially, Jonathan, who is the IT manager of the travel agency creates an organization profile on the bank&rsquo;s API marketplace. Then Donald also registers himself and adds the proposed application to the system. He browses the API marketplaces to find the most suitable ones, like a payment related API published by the bank itself, or APIs for messaging or acquiring weather forecast from external publishers. Once he finds the right APIs he can initiate subscribing to them. If he selects a payable plan, then he has to send a request to Jonathan to confirm the purchase.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<u><strong>Screen Requirements</strong></u><br />\nFor this challenge, we are providing wireframes for you&nbsp; to understand the flow. We would like you to design&nbsp; the following screens. Do not follow or copy the wireframes. It&#39;s just for reference. Please use your creativity to design the screens.<br />\n&nbsp;\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\"><strong>1. Developer Dashboard</strong></div>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">The user will need a landing screen where he gets after logging in to the tool. As the developer eventually can also be a publisher think of a way to be able to switch between two types of dashboards (developer and publisher). We will need the following items on the dashboard:</div>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Navigation: we need a global navigation for the app, where the user can navigate to the different areas of the application.</li>\n\t<li>Metrics: the user will be able to see some KPIs on his dashboard, like number of APIs subscribed, API consumption, App created or other related metrics. We are looking forward to your ideas regarding the KPIs.</li>\n\t<li>API list: On the dashboard the user will be able to see a small number of APIs in 3 categories: Top rated APIs, Recommended APIs and Most Frequently used APIs. Feel free to come up with your appropriate categories also. Each API should have its own card, with its logo, short description, free or paid tags and a link to see more details (you can explore the contents of the cards and include also the publisher, ratings, average latency, average api up time etc, that you feel useful).&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>The user should be able to initiate uploading his application to the system from the dashboard.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\"><br />\n<strong>2. Marketplace</strong></div>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">The user will be able to browse the available APIs on the marketplace. He will be able to use keyword search and use filters (For eg. API categories) to refine his findings. We would like to see a useful presentation of the APIs available. You could also consider a grid and a list view.<br />\n&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\"><strong>3. API Details</strong><br />\nThe API Details will show all the information a developer would like to know about an API. One API might have several versions, that the user can select from. The API details consist of different screens as follows:&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:80px\"><strong>a. API Details</strong><br />\nThis is the default screen of the API details pages. The user will see the API details in a plugin, like <a href=\"https://editor.swagger.io\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> (consider only the right side, not the code). Besides the plugin we would like you to show the following data:</div>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Name of API</li>\n\t<li>Description</li>\n\t<li>Publisher name</li>\n\t<li>Organization name (the publisher belongs to)</li>\n\t<li>Paid or free tag</li>\n\t<li>Support contacts (e-mail, phone number)</li>\n\t<li>Support forum link</li>\n\t<li>A link to initiate subscription</li>\n\t<li>A download link (Swagger and POSTMAN)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:80px\"><strong>b. API Documentation</strong><br />\nOn this page the user can find the documentation of the API, which can be articles, documents or even video tutorials. The user can open or download the documentation files of the selected API.<br />\n<strong>c. API Documentation Details</strong><br />\nShow us how the documentation file will look like when the user opens it.<br />\n<strong>d. API Consumption</strong><br />\nThis screen is only available for users who initially subscribed to the selected API. Navigating to this screen the user will be able to see the API consumption during the subscription period as API calls during a period. This period should be able to be modified/zoomed into. The user should be able to download usage reports.<br />\n&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\"><strong>4. Subscription Flow</strong><br />\nThe user will initiate API subscriptions from the API Details screen.&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:80px\"><strong>a. Subscription Details</strong><br />\nThe user will start by creating his application&rsquo;s profile in the system (this is not in scope). He might have more than one application. When he initiates the subscription, he has to select which application(s) will need the selected API.&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>b. Subscription Pricing</strong><br />\nThe next step for the user is to select a pricing plan for the API, which has been offered be the API publisher, and send a request to the admin of his organization.&nbsp;</div>\n<br />\n<u><strong>Branding Guidelines</strong></u><br />\nPlease consider the below guidelines during your design process:\n<div style=\"margin-left:40px\">You have to follow our client&rsquo;s branding guidelines.<br />\nStock photos and stock icons are allowed from the <a

For easy searching files and links are extracted from the posts and also shown on &ldquo;Assets Library&rdquo; page inside folders. So each folder represents one topic and contains all the files and links that are extracted from the posts of that topic. As on the &ldquo;Assets Library&rdquo; page many files and links could be shown we want to make it easier for users to quickly locate a file or link.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:16pt\">Technology Stack</span></h2>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">React</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">Redux</span></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; font-size:11pt\">CSS Modules</span></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:16pt\">Code access</span></h2>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">The work for this challenge has to be done in one repository:</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">- Connect App repo </span><a href=\"https://github.com/appirio-tech/connect-app\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">https://github.com/appirio-tech/connect-app</span></a><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\"> branch </span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:courier new; font-size:11pt\">dev</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\"> commit </span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:courier new; font-size:11pt\">3663fb065b4d98ff56981b7ca3626b12eca345fb</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\"> or later.</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">- Demo user is provided on the forum.</span></p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:16pt\">Individual requirements</span></h2>\n\n<h3><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(67, 67, 67); font-family:arial; font-size:14pt\">Small fixes</span></h3>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">- rename &ldquo;Modified&rdquo; column name to &ldquo;Date&rdquo;</span><br />\n<span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">- <s>in the &ldquo;Created by&rdquo; column show user &ldquo;handle&rdquo; instead of the full name to save the space</s>&nbsp;- <strong>ignore</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">- align all column headers and data to the right, except of &ldquo;...&rdquo; buttons, see </span><a href=\"https://monosnap.com/file/SddxYwm6vVAPurhHFRJBfeuG63jUEG\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\"><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(17, 85, 204); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">screenshot</span></a><br />\n<span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">- make the width of the last column smaller to sage the space</span><br />\n<span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">- make the font-size for column headers same: `</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:courier new; font-size:11pt\">$tc-body-sm</span><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">` (13px)</span></p>\n\n<h3><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(67, 67, 67); font-family:arial; font-size:14pt\">Add a column &ldquo;Shared With&rdquo;</span></h3>\n\n<p><span style=\"background-color:transparent; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial; font-size:11pt\">Add column after &ldquo;Name&rdquo; column.
